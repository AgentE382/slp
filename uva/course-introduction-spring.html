## Course Introduction
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Compressed course introduction
- Pretty much everything is the same as last semester, expect for the few things mentioned herein
  - See last semester's [course introduction slide set](course-introduction-fall.html#/), and the [course syllabus](syllabus.html) ([md](syllabus.md)), for details
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Iteration plan
- There will be 8 two-week iterations this semester (numbered 7-14); iteration 7 started yesterday
  - We have new leads and secretaries
- The system must be *feature-complete* by the end of iteration 11 (March 27th)
  - Missing this deadline will result in <strong class="red">failure for the course</strong>!
  - Recall that we have a [bunch of tutorials](http://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) about how to implement various things
- That leaves iterations 12-14 for transition: bug fixes, tweaks, testing, deployment, documentation, maintenance, etc.
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Wait? documentation, you say???
- Yes, documentation:
  - Transition plan (consists of the deployment plan, test plan(s), etc.)
  - User manual
  - Installation instructions
  - Programming reference
  - Updated requirements document
  - STS technical report
- I'm looking for complete documentation, not necessarily long-winded documentation
- I will provide detailed instructions as to what goes into each
  - It's in the [deliverables](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/) slide set, which will be gone over in lecture
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Making progress
- As there is no additional semester after this one to complete the project, you will be held to your various requirements:
  - The original requirements document
  - Updated versions of this requirements document
  - Issues entered into github
- Not completing these requirements means that you did not complete the project!
- Among other things, this means:
  - You have to make more actual progress!
  - Last semester some groups didn't make 'actual progress' until the end of the semester...
  - And you will need to keep your github issues updated
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Course meetings
- The weekly schedule will be the same as last semester:
  - Mondays: group meeting day
  - Wednesday: lecture or group work day
  - Friday: no class, unless otherwise notified
- As the semester goes on, we will have less lectures are more group work days
  - This is intentional
- I'm going to get cranky if people are always coming in late to Monday and Wednesday's classes...
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## STS 4600
- Most of you are using this course as the STS 4600 technical project
  - You must let me know when the STS 4600 due dates come up, as I have no other way of finding out
- The *entire* group will work on the technical report (not just the STS 4600 students)
  - It will be an article about 6 pages in length; I will make a template available as we approach that date
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown id="phases"><script type="text/template">
## Semester Phases
- For the 6 person groups, there will be 3 phases:
  - Phase 4: iterations 7-9 (3 iterations)
  - Phase 5: iterations 10-11 (2 iterations)
  - Phase 6: iterations 12-14 (3 iterations)
- For the 7 person group, there will be 4 phases:
  - Phase 4: iterations 7-8 (2 iterations)
  - Phase 5: iterations 9-10 (2 iterations)
  - Phase 6: iterations 11-12 (2 iterations)
  - Phase 7: iterations 13-14 (2 iterations)
- If there are groups of other sizes, we will chat individually about how to handle this
- Full schedule can be found [here](index.html) ([md](index.md)), at the bottom
	  </script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Status
- Your customer should have used the system over break
- You should thus have feedback from him or her
  - (you may have to email them to remind them to send you that feedback)
- That, plus existing github issues, should provide you some idea of what to work on in the current iteration
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Meetings
- You do not have to have your bi-weekly meeting with the customer this iteration, **AS LONG AS** you get email feedback instead
  - Although you are welcome to do so
- The bi-weekly meetings with the customer and also graduate TA will start next iteration
  - We'll have a scheduling session during next Monday's group meeting lecture
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Deployment Plan
- The deliverable for iteration 7 is the **Deployment Plan**
  - We are going to go over it in detail next Wednesday
  - It will require input from the customer (via email is fine)
- If you are going to have a customer meeting **BEFORE** next Wednesday's lecture, you must speak to me in class today or on Monday, and I'll fill you in on what you need to ask
  - You can see a preview [here](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/deployment-plan), but that slide set is not yet complete
  - Much of this was done last semester, so it should be relatively easy
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Grades reminder
From the [first lecture in the fall](course-introduction-fall.html#/) (specifically, [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/grades)):

- Not completing time sheets or surveys will penalize your grade
  - Likewise with reports
- ***EVERYBODY*** is expected to contribute to the project
  - This means, among other things, that there should be (real) git commits from everybody (and likely for each iteration)
- We can re-do the spring iteration evaluations, for example if we could not find something, as long as it is brought to our attention within a reasonable time frame (2 weeks from when they are released)
- Attendance is still required
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Course size issues
- About 5% of last semester's class will not be in this spring's class
  - No, they were not all due to failures
- Registration is currently at 87, and I expect it to hit 92
- This means some group sizes will be changing
- If your team size changed, then every team will have to fill out a new [SLP Project Start Information Sheet](../uva/project-start-info-sheet-2015.pdf)
  - Or chat with me as I walk around today
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Today's agenda: group meeting
- It's the beginning of iteration 7:
  - New leads and secretaries (and possibly re-doing the [SLP Project Start Information Sheet](../uva/project-start-info-sheet-2015.pdf))
  - Is your CI build green?
  - Did you get feedback from the customer?
  - What issues will be worked on during this iteration?
  - How will you get all of your features completed by the end of iteration 11?
  - Update the github issues and story point counts, as they are not looking like much of a burndown chart...
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Schedule for the first month
- Wed, Jan 18th (today): course introduction, group meetings
- Mon, Jan 23th: group meetings
- Wed, Jan 25th: [deliverables](11-deliverables.html#/) lecture
- Mon, Jan 30th: group meetings

- Mon, Feb 13th: group meetings
- Wed, Feb 15th: the rest of the [testing](12-testing.html#/) lecture
- Mon, Feb 20th: group meetings
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Iteration start-up
- Iteration 7 started yesterday
- The leads and secretaries are listed in the course management tool
  - I'll be emailing all the leads later today
  - The first deliverable by the (new) lead is the report, and I'll remind you about that on Monday
	</script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it7goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 7
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Update the requirements document with the work to be done for this semester
  - Since the minimum requirements were done last semester, this should all be under desired requirements
  - But this may need to be adjusted depending on last semester's progress, customer feedback, etc.
- Write the [deployment plan](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/deployment-plan)
  - Enter that as a docs/deployment-plan.md file in the repo
  - This is the document deliverable for this iteration
- Get feedback from the customer about the system, either in person or by email
  - This will be used to edit the requirements document and the github issues
- Edit the github issues to make them as reasonably accurate as you can at this point
- Plan out what to do in the next iteration (include that in the TPS report)
