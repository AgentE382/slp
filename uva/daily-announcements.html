<h4>Fixing Problems</h4>
<img class="stretch" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/fixing_problems.png" title="&#39;What was the original problem you were trying to fix?&#39; &#39;Well, I noticed one of the tools I was using had an inefficiency that was wasting my time.&#39;" alt="Fixing Problems">

## Wednesday, September 28th
- We are half-way through iteration 1
- The homeworks are all finished!  Yay!  We are working on grading them...
- You are welcome to use the VirtualBox Linux image for your development, or install it natively on your machine (more on how to do this shortly)
  - Plasmashell crash issue: the culprit seems to be tooltips, so try disabling them (right click taskbar -> Task Manager Settings -> General -> Uncheck "show tooltips")
- Leads: your weekly report was due yesterday by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo) for details
  - Everybody got it in!
  - You submit it via the [course administration system](https://slp.cs.virginia.edu:444/admin/)
  - Your TPS report will be due next Tuesday at noon, and we won't have class the day before for me to remind you...
- You can't `sudo` on the course server, so please stop trying
- My office hours are 9:30-10:30 on Mondays and 9:30-11:30 on Wednesdays
  - But I won't hold mine this Wednesday or next Wednesday unless you mention to me that you'll be there...	
- CS town hall with the CS dept chair!  Did anybody go?  How did it go?
- If you didn't sign the [legal agreement](student-participation-form.pdf) then you will have to do so today
- Schedule
  - Today we will see [project estimation](../slides/07-estimation.html), and start the estimating
  - Monday is fall break, so no class
  - Next Wednesday will be a group work day
  - The following weeks we will see: wireframing, continuous integration testing, and documentation
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it1goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for iteration 1
See [here](../slides/05-project-start.html#/it1goals) for full details, but briefly:

- Fully understand the requirements
- Meet with the customer
- Design (and implement) a basic DB schema
- Get your dev environment set up (see [uva-slp/tutorails](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) for guidance)
- Get a basic MVC site working on the course server
  - Once done, this will require you emailing me so that I can complete the apache2 configuration
- Have the system stored properly in the github repo (no passwords!!!)
  - That means having all your framework created files in an app/ folder!
- Enter all the requirements as tasks as Github issues as described [here](../slides/07-estimation.html#/task)
- Everybody MUST have a github commit this iteration (and, in general, every iteration)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it1goals"><script type="text/template">
## Getting the site running on the course server
- This is one of the requirements for iteration 1
- You will need to configure it on your end
  - Basically, follow the asme instructions as with the appropriate framework homework
  - For Django, this includes running wsgi-admin
- Then email me, so I can complete the installation
  - There are tweaks and such
  - The URL will then be http://server/tag (for django and rails) or http://server/~tag (for cake)
- Then adjust the system as necessary
- This means it requires some work on my end to get it fully functional
- I am NOT going to be staying up late next Monday, during my fall vacation, to do this for you
  - So don't wait until the last minute...

## Project notes and erratta
- Meeting reservation updates:
  - Normally, undergrads are *not* allowed to make room reservations in Rice as there are not enough conference rooms for even the faculty who want to meet
  - However, an exception has been (and will be) made for SLP students
  - Pursuant to this, *please* follow these two rules:
    - Please only make meetings for when you are meeting with the customer or grad TA (although Jordan will make the latter ones for you)
    - Please only make meetings for the times you need, and use it for those times!
  - I am very sorry that there are not more rooms for you all to meet separately
    - That being said, if you squat in a room, the worst that will happen is that somebody will ask you to leave...
- Communication tools: there are a bunch available
  - You can create a email list at https://lists.virginia.edu
  - You can (and should!) create a [slack account](https://slack.com)
  - And others...
- Note that the intent is for *all* of the group to be present at the customer (and graduate TA) meetings
- We have now entered our "tyipcal" schedule: group meetings (in class) on Mondays, lecture or in-class workday on Wednesdays, and no class on Fridays
- If you are interested, the entire list of iteration goals is in the [iteration goals slide set](iteration-goals.html#/)
  - Keep in mind that there may be a few tweaks to future goals, but I don't expect much to change
  - I will cut-and-paste the relevant goals from that into the daily announcements, so you don't have to check that file if you don't want to
	  </script></section>

          <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Grad TA Meeting Scheduling
- Each group needs to meet with Jordan, the graduate TA, once each iteration
  - It can be in the first or second week of the iteration
- The *ENTIRE* group needs to be present
- Each group should fill out the following doodle poll ONCE PER GROUP
  - http://tinyurl.com/jzxtk9c
  - Please put your project tag as the name
- Please fill out all times that the *ENTIRE* group is available
  - Please do this as soon as the announcements are over

## My Todos: All Done!
- Customers have been notified that the projects have started, so you are free to email them
- There are now group accounts (and databases) on the course server; the updated account info is in PostEm
  - Keep in mind that PostEm is moving to the course administration tool...
  - You are more than welcome to change the password, if you would like
  - Or you can set up [auto-login](../docs/dev-env-setup.html)
- The github repos are all ready, and issues and the wiki have been enabled on each
  - I did an initial commit for each
- You have access to the [uva-slp/tutorails](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) repo
  - Many of these will be quite useful in getting your account and development environment set up
  - Be wary, though -- as with everything online, some may be out of date

- We'll see it now: https://slp.cs.virginia.edu:444/admin/
- Note the oddball port number!!!
- If you go to https://slp.cs.virginia.edu, and click on "For Current Students", you will be redirected there

## Attendance check-in
- This is how we will take attendance during lectures
- Please check-in now:
  - Go to http://tinyurl.com/slpcheckin
  - Once that redirects (to https://slp.cs.virginia.edu:444/admin/checkins/checkin), you will need to Netbadge in
  - That's it!
  - Future check-ins may have you enter a code, but today doesn't
- Again, please check in *now*; I'll wait!
- Remember: if you miss class for a *valid* reason, you can submit an attendance excuse via the course management system

	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Descriptions
- They are in a github repo: https://github.com/uva-slp/projects
  - You were all invited to join the uva-slp organization last Friday
  - Note that you have to *accept* the invitation to view the repo!
  - If you lost that invitation email, go to https://github.com/uva-slp, and follow the prompts
  - You are welcome to read the past project descriptions, but the 2016 projects are what we care about
  - They are in Markdown, HTML, and PDF; you can easily view them on github via: https://github.com/uva-slp/projects/blob/master/2016/readme.md
- A few projects have *required* platforms:
  - Python/Django: Loaves & Fishes, UVa Info Sec
  - Ruby on Rails: Innisfree
  - Unknown: McIntire Botanical Garden (should know that in a day or two)
- Two projects are *REQUIRED* to be open source:
  - Programming Contests @ UVa and Meals on Wheels
- Everybody has to LOOK OVER each and every project!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Year Start Survey
- Everybody must complete this survey by the "end of the day" on Friday
  - If you don't, you won't get assigned to a project, and then you cannot complete this course
  - <font color='red'>JUST TO BE CLEAR: if you do not complete this survey, you will be dropped from the course!</font>
  - I will send you periodic reminders about this, so no need to panic and fill it out today, necessarily
  - It's due by the "end of the day" on Friday (which really means about 9 a.m. on Saturday morning)
- The survey prompt emails ran into "issues", so the URL for your participation is in Collab's PostEm tool
  - That URL is tagged to your userid, so we know who you are...
- The survey system has an annoying *timeout* "feature"
  - If it is idle for too long, any responses on that page that you have not submitted are lost
  - This really only happens when people keep it open, leave for lunch (or whatever), and then come back
  - It's a really stupid design, I know...
- The survey questions are on Collab in Resources/surveys/year-start, and you can veiw it from there
  - There are four pages: [1](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p1.html), [2](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p2.html), [3](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p3.html), and [4](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p4.html)
  - So if you want to ponder your responses, you can view it there first
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Optimizing the Survey Responses
- If your responses are too constrained, I won't be able to even come close to fulfilling them
- Requesting special situations
  - If you have an *entire* group that you want to work with, you have to:
    - Have *each* potential group member list all of you to work with (both in BFFs and the end comments)
    - List similar choices for projects, platforms, etc.
    - Be *very* flexible in which group (such as stating that you will work on any of them)
  - Mortal Enemies can also be people you like, but don't want to work with (I had an engaged pair list each other as mortal enemies once)
  - BFF's are *really* hard to manage, given the other constraints -- so feel free to fill it out, but don't count on it happening
    - If your BFF lists you as his/her BFF, then it has a slightly higher chance of happening
- If you state that you are not willing to work on an open source project, then you definitely will *not* be assigned to those two groups
- If you do have any connection to a given project (or framework), please not that in the comments as well

## Monday, September 12th
- The [frameworks HW](../docs/hw-frameworks.html) is finishing up today; see [here](#/frameworkshw) for details
  - It's *much* better to get it in late than to not get it in at all (say, within a few days after it's due)
- We have a VirtualBox Linux image all configured for you
  - Plasmashell crash issue: one possibility: tooltips, so try disabling them (right click taskbar -> Task Manager Settings -> General -> Uncheck "show tooltips")
  - This solved it on at least one student's machine!
- Project status: 16 docs written!
  - Although at least 1 will not be happening this year
  - We are going to go over them today
- You can't `sudo` on the course server, so please stop trying
- It is unclear if we will have class or not this Friday (Sep 16); I'll know more about that on Wednesday
- My office hours are 9:30-10:30 on Mondays and 9:30-11:30 on Wednesdays
- Today we will be will be talking about the projects and the survey
  - In any remaining time, we will be working through [requirements](../slides/04-requirements.html#/) (starting at slide [3.8](../slides/04-requirements.html#/2/7))

	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Descriptions
- They are in a github repo: https://github.com/uva-slp/projects
  - You were all invited to join the uva-slp organization last Friday
  - Note that you have to *accept* the invitation to view the repo!
  - If you lost that invitation email, go to https://github.com/uva-slp, and follow the prompts
  - You are welcome to read the past project descriptions, but the 2016 projects are what we care about
  - They are in Markdown, HTML, and PDF; you can easily view them on github via: https://github.com/uva-slp/projects/blob/master/2016/readme.md
- A few projects have *required* platforms:
  - Python/Django: Loaves & Fishes, UVa Info Sec
  - Ruby on Rails: Innisfree
  - Unknown: McIntire Botanical Garden (should know that in a day or two)
- Two projects are *REQUIRED* to be open source:
  - Programming Contests @ UVa and Meals on Wheels
- Everybody has to LOOK OVER each and every project!
- Let's go over the project descriptions...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Year Start Survey
- Everybody must complete this survey by the "end of the day" on Friday
  - If you don't, you won't get assigned to a project, and then you cannot complete this course
  - I will send you periodic reminders about this, so no need to panic and fill it out today, necessarily
- The survey prompt will be mailed to you today
  - That email is tagged to your userid, so we know who you are...
- The survey system has an annoying *timeout* "feature"
  - If it is idle for too long, any responses on that page that you have not submitted are lost
  - This really only happens when people keep it open, leave for lunch (or whatever), and then come back
  - It's a really stupid design, I know...
- The survey questions are on Collab in Resources/surveys/year-start, and you can veiw it from there
  - There are four pages: [1](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p1.html), [2](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p2.html), [3](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p3.html), and [4](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p4.html)
  - So if you want to ponder your responses, you can view it there first
- Let's go over the survey...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Optimizing the Survey Responses
- If your responses are too constrained, I won't be able to even come close to fulfilling them
- Requesting special situations
  - If you have an *entire* group that you want to work with, you have to:
    - Have *each* potential group member list all of you to work with (both in BFFs and the end comments)
    - List similar choices for projects, platforms, etc.
    - Be *very* flexible in which group (such as stating that you will work on any of them)
  - Mortal Enemies can also be people you like, but don't want to work with (I had an engaged pair list each other as mortal enemies once)
  - BFF's are *really* hard to manage, given the other constraints -- so feel free to fill it out, but don't count on it happening
    - If your BFF lists you as his/her BFF, then it has a slightly higher chance of happening
- If you state that you are not willing to work on an open source project, then you definitely will *not* be assigned to those two groups
- If you do have any connection to a given project (or framework), please not that in the comments as well

## Homework status
- The [git/github HW due](../docs/hw-git.html) was due last Wednesday
- The [frameworks HW](../docs/hw-frameworks.html) has three parts; the URLs **MUST** match what is listed below:
  - CakePHP, due Mon, 9/5 (end of the day): URL: http://server/~mst3k/cakephp/
    - As long as you put your code in `~/html/cakephp`, it will have that URL
  - Rails, due Fri, 9/9 (end of the day): URL: http://server/rails/mst3k
    - That URL is already configured, as long as your Rails project is in `~/railshw/`
  - Django, due Mon, 9/12 (end of the day): URL: http://server/django/mstek
    - You set this up via the `wsgi-admin` call; we recommend putting it in `~/djangohw/`
- The course server is all configured and ready to go
  - You can find your account info in the Collab Post'Em tool
  - SSH keys: 
    - RSA key fingerprint is 51:c6:7e:a6:44:b3:8e:f9:85:57:e0:7f:fb:c7:20:d3
    - ECDSA key fingerprint is ed:1c:0e:61:94:2c:3f:53:d1:f1:dd:90:9b:f7:cb:a7
  - In theory, you should not require `sudo` to complete anything
- You have three databases that you can use (all use the same password): `mst3k`, `test_mst3k`, and `mst3k_test`
  - Use them however you would like to make the three projects work
  - If you need a fourth to make it work, let me know
- There are a few custom commands on the course server that you can use:
  - `reload-apache2`: reloads the web server
  - `view-apache2-log`: views the apache2 log
  - `wsgi-admin`: to register your Django application
- Each framework has a "getting started" page that is also updated

  - SSH keys: 
    - RSA key fingerprint is 51:c6:7e:a6:44:b3:8e:f9:85:57:e0:7f:fb:c7:20:d3
    - ECDSA key fingerprint is ed:1c:0e:61:94:2c:3f:53:d1:f1:dd:90:9b:f7:cb:a7
  - In theory, you should not require `sudo` to complete anything
- You have three databases that you can use (all use the same password): `mst3k`, `test_mst3k`, and `mst3k_test`
  - Use them however you would like to make the three projects work
  - If you need a fourth to make it work, let me know
- There are a few custom commands on the course server that you can use:
  - `reload-apache2`: reloads the web server
  - `view-apache2-log`: views the apache2 log
  - `wsgi-admin`: to register your Django application
- Each framework has a "getting started" page that is also updated

## Monday, August 29th
- The [first homework, on git and github](../../docs/hw-git.html), is out; it's due Wednesday (Aug 31) by the end of the day
  - There is also a brief [intro to git](../../docs/git-intro.html) as well, and everybody should at least skim through it...
  - You have to allow `aaronbloomfield` and `cjmincey` to be Collaborators on any private repos you create for this assignment, but *after* you complete the homework!
- The [frameworks HW](../docs/hw-frameworks.html) is also ready; more on this on the next slide
- We have a VirtualBox Linux image all configured for you
  - The image is on Collab's Resources; also see the [installation
  - Make sure you specify that it's a 64-bit guest!
  - Also see the [installation instructions](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/tutorials/01-intro-unix/virtual-box.html) (from CS 2150's lab 1) and the [image details](../docs/virtualbox-image-details.html)
- Unlike CS 2150, I don't care what system you develop on
  - But most (if not all) of the software will be on a LAMP system, so you'll have to use something similar to LAMP.  I've seen people set up Mac OS X to run MAMP, and Windows to run WAMP...
- Please fill out the github userid survey at http://goo.gl/Vjn3Yx by Wednesday of next week
  - Why don't you do that now?
  - You should have received an email about that
  - I will need that information to get your assignments graded, and to release the project information to you
- Today we will be going through [legal issues](../slides/01-legal.html)

## Homework status
- The [git/github HW due](../docs/hw-git.html) is due by Wednesday (end of the day)
- The [frameworks HW](../docs/hw-frameworks.html) has three parts; the URLs **MUST** match what is listed below:
  - CakePHP, due Mon, 9/5; URL: http://server/~mst3k/cakephp/
    - As long as you put your code in `~/html/cakephp`, it will have that URL
  - Rails, due Fri, 9/9: URL: http://server/rails/mst3k
    - That URL is already configured, as long as your Rails project is in `~/railshw/`
  - Django, due Mon, 9/12: URL: http://server/django/mstek
    - You set this up via the `wsgi-admin` call; we recommend putting it in `~/djangohw/`
- The course server is all configured and ready to go
  - You can find your account info in the Collab Post'Em tool
  - SSH keys: 
    - RSA key fingerprint is 51:c6:7e:a6:44:b3:8e:f9:85:57:e0:7f:fb:c7:20:d3
