## Friday, February 8th
- We are at in the middle of iteration 8
  - Leads: your weekly reports are due tomorrow by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo) for details
  - The deliverable for this iteration is the [installation instructions](../slides/../slides/11-deliverables.html#/installation)
  - Customer meetings and grad TA meetings should happen starting with iteration 8!
  - Iteration goals are below...
- Iteration 7 evaluations have been released
  - Remember that you have two weeks (from today) to ask for a re-evaluation; email Wasi for that, or bring it up at your meeting with him
- Reminders (all done via the [course administration tool](https://slp.cs.virginia.edu/admin))
  - Don't forget to report your hours!  This is a course requirement
  - Also, please don't forget to submit meeting reports whenever you meet with a customer (but don't do this with the meetings with the grad TA)
  - Likewise, all group meetings need to have notes taken
    - You can back-date meeting notes, if necessary (via stating so in the title)
  - If you miss class for a *valid* reason, please submit an excuse for that day to prevent you from being marked absent
- Remember that you have access to the [uva-slp/tutorials](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) repo; while some may be outdated, many will be *quite* useful, such as setting up your dev platform
- Today is a group work day

## Goals for Iteration 7
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Update the requirements document with the work to be done for this semester
  - Since the minimum requirements were done last semester, this should all be under desired requirements
  - But this may need to be adjusted depending on last semester's progress, customer feedback, etc.
- Write the [deployment plan](../slides/../slides/11-deliverables.html#/deployment-plan)
  - Enter that as a docs/deployment-plan.md file in the repo
  - This is the document deliverable for this iteration
- Get feedback from the customer about the system, either in person or by email
  - This will be used to edit the requirements document and the github issues
- Edit the github issues to make them as reasonably accurate as you can at this point
- Plan out what to do in the next iteration (include that in the TPS report)
