## Monday, April 4th
- Development is over!  Can't you just taste the upcoming summer vacation???
  - But we still have work to do...
- We are in the middle of iteration 12; iteration goals are on a successive slide
  - Leads: your weekly reports are due tomorrow by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo) for details
  - With the end of iteration 11, 6 person groups had a phase change (and an end-of-phase survey); the survey prompts have already been sent out
    - It is going to be shut off after today!
- Note that all the iteration goals are in the [iteration-goals.html](iteration-goals.html#/) slide set
- Evaluations
  - Iteration 11 group evaluations have been released; you have until April 18th to complain
- We've discussed the [grad TA meeting schedule](#/gradtaschedule), the [spring semester iterations and phases](#/phasechanges) and the [phase change schedule](#/phasechangeschedule)
- You will still be meeting with the customer & grad TA throughout transition!
- Reminders (all done via the [course administration tool](https://slp.cs.virginia.edu/admin))
  - Don't forget to report your hours!  This is a course requirement
  - Also, please don't forget to submit meeting reports whenever you meet with a customer 
  - Likewise, all group meetings need to have notes taken (backdate via noting such in the title)
  - If you miss class for a *valid* reason, please submit an excuse to avoid being marked absent
- Remember that you have access [uva-slp/tutorials](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) repo
- Today is a group work day
  - With the end of the testing lecture set, there is not as much relevant material to lecture about (as expected), and we will start having group workdays on Wednesdays as well

## A few other notes
- All the CircleCI folks will be migrating to TravisCI
  - CircleCI did not give me the free container that they said they would in September...
  - This is unfortunate, as there are some things I *really* like about CircleCI (such as being able to ssh into their containers)
  - This change-over should be easy, and I will send out emails to the affected groups
  - I have already enabled TravisCI for all the SLP repos
- Everybody is going to have to convert their system to run in Python's virtualenv
  - We are going to do this in class today
  - It should also be easy, and I will have detailed directions
  - It will take all of 5 minutes to configure, and another 5 to install the packages
- [Final presentations](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/finalpres)
  - We decided to have then during class
  - They will commence on Friday, April 22nd, and continue through the next week (Monday, April 25th, and Wednesday, April 27th)
  - We will only use the next Friday (April 29th) if we do not finish them in time
  - Yes, attendance is still required at these
  - Everybody will have 15 minutes to present -- while you should not be short, if you run over, then we won't finish three people per class...

## Goals for Iteration 12
- Devlierables
  - [User manual](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/usermanual) (draft, but a good draft)
  - [STS technical report](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/stsreport) (draft or outline)
    - It's due to me either at the end of iteration 13 or two weeks before STS needs it signed, whichever comes first
- Testing
  - [Main code coverage](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage) at 100% (and updated [code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage))
    - Anything not covered should be described in a code-coverage-excuses.md file
  - [Javascript code coverage](../slides/12-testing.html#/jscodecoverage) should be at 75% (and update the jscoverage.pdf file)
  - [Specific test plans](../slides/12-testing.html#/specificplans) (written)
    - This includes: installation test plan, usability test plan, security test plan, requriements test plan, compatibility test plan
  - Ensure unit tests can be run on the course server
  - All tests must pass (including green CI status and being able to run the tests on the course server)
- Implement any updates, tweaks, UI fixes, or bug fixes found by you or the customer
- You should start thinking about (and reserving) your [final tutorial](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/tutorials) choice
	  </script></section>

## Fix our credentials!
- What is the set of passwords in *ALL* of the credentials supplied to us so we could log in to your systems that hold *confidential* data?
  - {admin, password, test, (name of project)]
  - Yes, that's it.  And 3 are 'password'
- Please *immediately* change the passwords on your systems!
  - These systems will (or do) hold CONFIDENTIAL data!
  - Make up some very compilcated password for our credentials
    - We are going to cut-and-paste it anyway...
- Then update your iteration 10 report
  - Otherwise we won't be able to log in, and we'll get all cranky-pants
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Moving over to virtualenv
- On pegasus, using the `virtualenv` command, create your virtual environment
  - Pick a reasonable directory name: ~/venv-django-1.8, or whatever:
```
virtualenv ~/venv-django-1.8
```
  - Add "`-p /usr/bin/python3`" right after "`virtualenv`" if you are using Python 3
- Email me the directory name so I can configure the web server
  - Not much will work until that's configured properly
- Enter the virtual environment: from the command line, enter:
```
source ~/venv-django-1.8/bin/activate
```
  - You will notice a difference in the prompt
  - You can leave the virtual environment by entering `deactivate` (or just logging out)
- Install the packages that you need via pip (or pip3, if you are using Python3):
```
pip install foo
pip install bar==1.2.3
```
  - Your installation instructions should list all the packages (and versions) that you need installed!
- Reload the web server as needed: `/usr/local/bin/reload-apache2`

## Github Story Points<br>Hall of Shame

Remember that *all* issues (even closed ones) must have a story points tag.  The following do not:

&nbsp;

- None!

&nbsp;

You can give a tag of "story-points-none" if the task is not worth any story points

  - When do we want to have them?  Two choices:
  - One is to have them during the final exam period (Thu, May 5, from 9 a.m. to noon)
    - Everybody has to show up!  Or you get a zero for the final exam
  - The other is during class time, but that means we will have to meet on one or two Fridays
    - You all have to show up for that as well!

## Monday, March 28th
- We are at the end of iteration 11; iteration goals are below
  - Leads: your TPS reports are due tomorrow by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo) for details

  - With the end of iteration 11, 6 person groups will have a phase change (and an end-of-phase survey); the survey prompts will be sent out shortly
- Evaluations
  - Iteration 9 and 10 group evaluations have been released; you have until March 28th (for it 9) and April 4th (for it 10) to request a re-eval
  - Individual mid-semester [evaluations were released as well](#/indivevals); you also have until March 28th to submit a regrade to the "Individual mid-semester evaluation, spring 2016" assignment
- We've discussed the [grad TA meeting schedule](#/gradtaschedule), the [spring semester iterations and phases](#/phasechanges) and the [phase change schedule](#/phasechangeschedule)

## Goals for Iteration 11
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Complete the full transition plan
  - Really this means make any edits or updates to the [master test plan](../slides/12-testing.html#/mastertestplan), [deployment plan](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/deployment-plan), and [installation instructions](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/installation)
  - This is the document deliverable for this iteration; but if those are fully up to date, then there will not be much work to do on this part
- Ensure the system is at 80% code coverage
  - And update the [code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage) report in the docs/coverage/ directory
- Javascript code coverage should be at 50% (and update the jscoverage.pdf file)
- Note that the system was *fully deployed* on the destination server last iteration
- The system must be *feature complete* (meaning all the minimum and desired requirements) by the end of this iteration
  - It must be running on both the course server as well as the deployment host
- The requirements document must be fully updated and in sync with the deployed system
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Notes about future iterations
- ~~The deliverable for iteration 9 is the [code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage)~~
- ~~The deliverable for iteration 10 will be the [master test plan](../slides/12-testing.html#/mastertestplan)~~
  - ~~You will also start having to have Javascript code coverage~~
- The deliverable for iteration 11 will be the transition plan
  - Really just edits and updates to the other four documents ([deployment plan](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/deployment-plan), 
[installation instructions](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/installation), [code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage) (and the [Javascript code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/jscodecoverage)), and [master test plan](../slides/12-testing.html#/mastertestplan))
- The system must be *fully deployed* by the end of iteration **10**
  - That is March 14th, one full iteration before development ends
  - I realize that the system may not be complete by that point
- The fully implemented system must be deployed by the end of iteration 11 (March 28th)
- There will be very few iteration goals for those iterations beyond what is listed above
- Iterations 12-14 will consist of testing, documentation, system tweaking and bug fixing, and general maintenance tasks
- You can always see the full set of iteration goals in the [iteration goals](iteration-goals.html#/) slide set

## Goals for Iteration 11
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Complete the full transition plan
  - Really this means make any edits or updates to the [master test plan](../slides/12-testing.html#/mastertestplan), [deployment plan](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/deployment-plan), and [installation instructions](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/installation)
  - This is the document deliverable for this iteration; but if those are fully up to date, then there will not be much work to do on this part
- Ensure the system is at 80% code coverage
  - And update the [code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage) report in the docs/coverage/ directory
- Javascript code coverage should be at 50% (and update the jscoverage.pdf file)
- Note that the system was *fully deployed* on the destination server last iteration
- The system must be *feature complete* (meaning all the minimum and desired requirements) by the end of this iteration
  - It must be running on both the course server as well as the deployment host
- The requirements document must be fully updated and in sync with the deployed system

## Notes about future iterations
- ~~The deliverable for iteration 9 is the [code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage)~~

- The system must be *fully deployed* by the end of iteration **10**
  - That is March 14th, one full iteration before development ends
  - I realize that the system may not be complete by that point
- The fully implemented system must be deployed by the end of iteration 11 (March 28th)
- There will be very few iteration goals for those iterations beyond what is listed above
- Iterations 12-14 will consist of testing, documentation, system tweaking and bug fixing, and general maintenance tasks
- You can always see the full set of iteration goals in the [iteration goals](iteration-goals.html#/) slide set

## Wednesday, March 16th
- We are at the start of iteration 11; iteration goals are below
  - Leads: your TPS reports were due yesterday by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo) for details
  - The deliverable for this iteration is the transition plan (see next slide), as well as (now) 80% main code coverage *and* 50% Javascript code coverage
  - With the end of iteration 10, 7 person groups will have a phase change (and an end-of-phase survey); the survey prompts were sent out last night
  - Did you submit an 'other' report with the deployed URL and the login credentials?  If not, then we assume it is not deployed (which is not good)
- Evaluations
  - Iteration 9 group evaluations have been released; you have until March 28th to request a re-eval
  - Individual mid-semester [evaluations were released as well](#/indivevals); you also have until March 28th to submit a regrade to the "Individual mid-semester evaluation, spring 2016" assignment
- We've discussed the [grad TA meeting schedule](#/gradtaschedule), the [spring semester iterations and phases](#/phasechanges) and the [phase change schedule](#/phasechangeschedule)
- Reminders (all done via the [course administration tool](https://slp.cs.virginia.edu/admin))

## Individual mid-semester evaluation
- These have been released!
- They are in the Postem tab in the [course administration tool](https://slp.cs.virginia.edu/admin)
  - Not in Collab!
- These are not used *directly* in determining the final course grade
  - We will re-determine things at the end of the semester
  - But it provides a good idea of what we are thinking at this point
- Many of the fields are information stored elsewhere
  - Reported hours, content from the evaluations, etc.
  - Other fields can't be determined until the end of the semester
  - The two most relevant fields are:
    - mid-semester individual rating of the work you are doing
    - mid-semester individual rating comments
- Please keep in mind that our information is imperfect!
  - The reason we do this evaluation is to give you a chance to correct any misconceptions that have occurred
  - And to make changes moving forward
- If we got anything wrong, please fill out a regrade for the "Individual mid-semester evaluation, spring 2016" assignment
  - Make it clear what we missed!
- Please submit any regrades within two weeks from today (so until March 28th)

## Wednesday, February 24th
- We are in the middle of iteration 9
  - Leads: your weekly reports were due yesterday by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo) for details
    - Two groups didn't get it in...
  - The deliverable for this iteration is the [code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage), as well as 60% unit test coverage
  - Iteration goals are on a successive slide...
  - We plan on doing a mid-semester individual evaluation with the iteration 9 group evaluations
- Iteration 8 group evaluations were released
  - Remember that you have two weeks (from when they were released) to ask for a re-evaluation; email Wasi for that, or bring it up at your meeting with him
  - With the end of iteration 8, all 7 person groups (and those following the 7 person group schedule) have to fill out the end-of-phase surveys; reminders have been sent
    - You can't wait forever to complete this!  It is very bad to not complete the surveys.
- We've discussed the [grad TA meeting schedule](#/gradtaschedule), the [spring semester iterations and phases](#/phasechanges) and the [phase change schedule](#/phasechangeschedule)
- Reminders (all done via the [course administration tool](https://slp.cs.virginia.edu/admin))
  - Don't forget to report your hours!  This is a course requirement
  - Also, please don't forget to submit meeting reports whenever you meet with a customer 
  - Likewise, all group meetings need to have notes taken (backdate via noting such in the title)
  - If you miss class for a *valid* reason, please submit an excuse to avoid being marked absent
- Remember that you have access [uva-slp/tutorials](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) repo; while some may be outdated, many will be *quite* useful, such as setting up your dev platform
- Today is the first of two lectures on [testing](../slides/12-testing.html#/)

## Goals for Iteration 9
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Complete the [code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage)
  - The system must be at 60% code coverage!
  - That report should be in a docs/coverage/ directory; the output of your code coverage command is the format we are looking for
  - This is the document deliverable for this iteration
- Ensure that your other deliverables are up to date, along with your requirements document
  - That's the [deployment plan](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/deployment-plan) and
[installation instructions](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/installation)
- Keep in mind that the system must be fully deployed (if not yet fully complete) by the end of iteration 10
- Keep in mind that the system must be feature complete by the end of iteration 11, so plan your work accordingly

## Code Coverage Report Overview
- Due to the snow days, we may not get to the [full description](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage) in time
- To complete the steps:
  - Run the appropriate commands for your particular language: see [PHP/CakePHP](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage-php), [Python/Django](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage-python), or [Ruby/Rails](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage-rails)
  - In all cases, we want the HTML version of the report
  - We are looking for you to test *your* code, not the CakePHP / Django / Rails library itself
    - Nor any other libraries or packages or gems that you use
- You must also have 60% of your code covered by unit tests
  - We are focusing on the PHP, Python, or Ruby code; no Javascript code yet

## Notes about future iterations
- The deliverable for iteration 9 is the [code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage)
- The deliverable for iteration 10 will be the [master test plan](../slides/12-testing.html#/mastertestplan)
  - You will also start having to have Javascript code coverage
- But note that the testing slide set, where both those links are to, still needs to be updated
- The deliverable for iteration 11 will be the transition plan
  - Really just edits and updates to the other four documents ([deployment plan](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/deployment-plan), 
[installation instructions](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/installation), [code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage), and [master test plan](../slides/12-testing.html#/mastertestplan))
- The system must be *fully deployed* by the end of iteration **10**
  - That is March 14th, one full iteration before development ends
  - I realize that the system may not be complete by that point
- The fully implemented system must be deployed by the end of iteration 11 (March 28th)
- There will be very few iteration goals for those iterations beyond what is listed above
- Iterations 12-14 will consist of testing, documentation, system tweaking and bug fixing, and general maintenance tasks

## Phase changes
- Six person grounds and 7 person groups will have different phases; as per the [spring course introtduction](course-introduction-spring.html#/) (specifically, [here](course-introduction-spring.html#/phases)):
- For the 6 person groups, there will be 3 phases:
  - Phase 4: iterations 7-9 (3 iterations)
  - Phase 5: iterations 10-11 (2 iterations)
  - Phase 6: iterations 12-14 (3 iterations)

  - Phase 6: iterations 11-12 (2 iterations)

## Goals for Iteration 8
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- This iteration starts the regular meetings with the customer and also the graduate TA
- Write the [installation instructions](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/installation)
  - Enter that as a docs/installation-instructions.md file in the repo
  - This is the document deliverable for this iteration
- Keep in mind that the system must be feature complete by the end of iteration 11, so plan your work accordingly
	</script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Notes about future iterations
- The deliverable for iteration 9 will be the [code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage)
- The deliverable for iteration 10 will be the [master test plan](../slides/12-testing.html#/mastertestplan)
- But note that the testing slide set, where both those links are to, still needs to be updated
- The deliverable for iteration 11 will be the transition plan
  - Really just edits and updates to the other four documents ([deployment plan](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/deployment-plan), 
[installation instructions](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/installation), [code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage), and [master test plan](../slides/12-testing.html#/mastertestplan))
- The system must be *fully deployed* by the end of iteration **10**
  - That is March 14th, one full iteration before development ends
  - I realize that the system may not be complete by that point
- The fully implemented system must be deployed by the end of iteration 11 (March 28th)
- There will be very few iteration goals for those iterations beyond what is listed above
- Iterations 12-14 will consist of testing, documentation, system tweaking and bug fixing, and general maintenance tasks
- You can always see the full set of iteration goals in the [iteration goals](iteration-goals.html#/) slide set

- Get feedback from the customer about the system, either in person or by email

- Edit the github issues to make them as reasonably accurate as you can at this point
- Plan out what to do in the next iteration (include that in the TPS report)
