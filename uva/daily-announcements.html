## Wednesday, October 21st, 2015
- We are at at the beginning of iteration 3 (day 1)
  - Leads: your TPS reports were due yesterday; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reports) for details
- Phase change!
  - With the start of iteration 3, we have new leads and new secretaries
  - There is also an end-of-phase survey to be completed; survey prompts were emailed to you last night
- Course server stuff (CNAME for URLs, installing packages, etc.)
- CS 4971 in the spring: 10 a.m. in THN E303 (good time, bad room)
- Iteration 1 evaluations released -- please look them over!  Goals are [here](../slides/05-project-start.html#/it1goals)
  - You have until October 28th to request a re-evaluation
- We hope to have the iteration 2 evaluations done by this Friday
- Reminders (all done via the [course administration tool][1])
  - Don't forget to report your hours!  This is a course requirement
  - Also, please don't forget to submit meeting reports whenever you meet with a customer (but don't do this with the meetings with the grad TA)
  - Likewise, all group meetings need to have notes taken
    - You can back-date meeting notes, if necessary (via stating so in the title)
  - If you miss class for a *valid* reason, please submit an excuse for that day to prevent you from being marked absent
- New repo you have access to: [uva-slp/tutorials](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials); while some may be outdated, many will be *quite* useful, such as setting up your dev platform

## End of phase survey
- Everybody has to fill it out!  It's a course requirement
- We went over it on Monday
- It should take about 10 minutes to complete
- The same survey will be completed after each phase
  - So you will have to complete as many as there are members in your group
- You can see the questions asked [here][5] (it's in Collab, under Resources/surveys/end_of_phase); it has pages [1][1], [2][2], [3][3], and [4][4]
- There is about a week-long period to fill it out
- You will receive a survey prompt in a day or so, as well as increasingly anxious reminders
- There is a *timeout* issue with regard to filling out surveys
  - LimeSurvey (the survey tool being used) will time you out after 10 (or so) minutes -- and then you'll have to start over!
  - So, if you want to spend time thinking about the responses, look over the survey in Collab first!
  - If you do get timed out, I can send you your previouslly completed responses

## Goals for Iteration 3
- Complete 24 / 28 / 32 story points worth of stuff
  - Some of this will be the work done on the wireframing, some will be the work done on the CI testing
  - Your site should have significnantly more functionality than last time
- Show the wireframe to the customer, get their feedback, iterate on the design
- You will have to configure your site with one of two CI servers: [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/) or [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
  - The [last two slides](../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/howtobegin) of the [Continuous Integration Testing](../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/) slide set discuss how to begin
  - Each group was assigned to one or the other; assignments are [here](../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/assignments)
  - The respective CI server is already set up to run tests on your repo on every push
  - Yout have to write the configuration file to get it to work properly
  - Extensive instructions for how to configure it (as well as sample configured projects) are available: the [CI testing slide set](../slides/09-ci-testing.html), the [CI setup](../docs/ci-setup.html) page, and two sample configured repos ([cake3-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/cake3-test) and [django-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/django-test))
    - Because nobody is using Rails, the rails-test repo was not updated this year, and is not being made available
- You will have to write a number of unit tests (at least 5 per person)
	  </script></section>

## Attendance check-in
- Note that check-ins are only necessary when prompted
  - They don't hurt otherwise, but they don't do anything
- Please do an attendance check-in now: http://tinyurl.com/slpcheckin

  - Tomorrow's iteration change-over has our first *phase change* (new leads, new secretaries, and a end-of-phase survey to be completed); more on the survey in a bit...
- This week is hash lab week for CS 2150, so if you want to swing by my office hours, next week would probably work better...
- Course server stuff
  - CNAME for the URLs and the moving of the Django webserver config files...
  - Installing python packages on the server...
- Iteration 1 evaluations released -- please look them over!
  - The iteration 1 goals are [here](../slides/05-project-start.html#/it1goals)
  - You have two weeks (from when they were released) if you want your progress to be re-evaluated (i.e., until October 28th)
- We hope to have the iteration 2 evaluations done by this Friday
- Reminders
  - Don't forget to report your hours!  This is a course requirement, and done through the [course administration tool][1]

## Goals for iteration 2
- Have a site that should start to look like a workable site for the requirements
  - Some just had one or two MVC components for the first iteration (which was fine, as that is what was required for then)
- Complete 24 / 28 / 32 story points worth of "stuff" (depending on group size)
- Your regular iteration meeting with the customer and the grad TA should happen
- Specific goals:
  - Generate wireframes: that's in the [wireframes](../slides/08-wireframing.html#/) lecture; this will likely take 3 or 5 story points of work.  The intent is to show them to the customer in iteration 3
  - Enable easy deployment via automatic logins or ssh keys: see the [Development Environment Setup page](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/docs/dev-env-setup.html) for details.  This also includes enabling easy downloading of the database
  - Publishing to the course server is best done via a github web hook and deploy key; see [that same page](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/docs/dev-env-setup.html) for details, but only I can set up both of those due to the github security setup
  - Ensure that *everybody* in the development group can develop on his/her own machine
- Some things to keep in mind:
  - Your requrements document will be iterated on throughout the year
  - What format you keep it in is up to you (although we recommend markdown), but we need to be able to view it
  - Having the source (from the [uva-slp/projects repo](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects) repo) copied into a `docs/` directory in your repo is quite reasonable
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Goals for iteration 3
- We will go over these in more detail on Wednesday; this is just a preview
- Show the wireframe to the customer, get their feedback, iterate on the design
- Wednesday's lecture will be on [continuous integration testing](../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/)
  - Although that slide set is not quite ready yet...
  - The following Wednesday will be a CI testing workday instead of a lecture
- You will have to configure your site with one of two CI servers: [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/) or [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
  - Each group will be assigned to one or the other
  - Extensive instructions for how to configure it (as well as a sample configured project) will be provided
- Does anybody have a preference as to one service or the other?
  - If so, please email me, and I will try to accommodate it
  - Otherwise, I will balance out the groups between the two CI servers
- You will have to write a number of unit tests (at least 5 per person)
- And the normal 24 / 28 / 32 story points worth of "stuff"

## Scheduling issues
- My travel last week, combined with fall break happening at the start of iteration 2, really messed up the schedule more than I expected
- The plan was to do wireframing in iteration 2 -- I am going to still try to hold to that
  - If this causes an issue with your group, please speak to me
- Thus, we will have a [wireframing](../slides/08-wireframing.html#/) lecture today, and group meetings on Wednesday

- Once your system is up and running, you will need to email me so I can configure the apache webserver
  - Please don't assume that I will be able to guess when it's ready!
  - And I'm not going to handle this at the very last minute!
  - CakePHP should have the site working through http://server/~tag; Django via http://server/django/tag

## Goals for iteration 1
See [here](../slides/05-project-start.html#/it1goals) for full details, but briefly:

- Fully understand the requirements
- Meet with the customer
- Design (and implement) a basic DB schema
- Get your dev environment set up (see [uva-slp/tutorails](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) for guidance)
- Get a basic MVC site working on the course server
  - Once done, this will require you emailing me so that I can complete the apache2 configuration
- Have the system stored properly in the github repo (no passwords!!!)
- Enter all the requirements as tasks as Github issues (this is next Wednesday)
- Everybody MUST have a github commit this iteration (and, in general, every iteration)

## [Center for Open Science](http://cos.io) project
- This project was added very late
  - Partly due to a late realization that it could work in the context of this course
  - And partly due to another project's cancellation
- We don't yet have the description for the project
- So I wasn't sure what to do:
  - Hold off on releasing the survey until the project description is ready
  - Or release the survey now, and talk, at a high level, about the project
- I decided to do the latter...
- THIS WILL BE AN APACHE 2.0 LICENSE PROJECT!!!
  - You will have to sign a form agreeing to release your code under this license
  - Feel free to select any of the other projects, as they don't have licensing restrictions

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Preferences survey
- An email prompt will be sent to you later today
- An overview of the survey can be found in Collab (in [Resources/surveys/year-start][0])
  - Specifically, pages [1][1], [2][2], [3][3], and [4][4] 
- It must be filled out by the end of the day on Friday
  - This is a <strong class="red">HARD DEADLINE!</strong>
- We'll go over the survey today
- Be aware of the timeout issue!
  - LimeSurvey (the survey tool being used) will time you out after 10 (or so) minutes
    - And then you'll have to start over!
  - So, if you want to spend time thinking about the responses, look over the survey in Collab first!

## Preferences survey hints
- If you really want to work with somebody...
  - You should both list each other as BFFs
  - And ensure that you have similar preferences for things
  - I can't guarantee that, of course
- If you have a group that wants to work together...
  - Everybody should list everybody else as BFFs
  - You need to be VERY flexbile in the project and platform
  - Mention, in the comments at the end of page 4, that you want to work as a group
- If you list too many constraints (too many BFFs, too many mortal enemies, etc.), the problem is just too overconstrained, and I will ignore your input
