## Wednesday, March 13th
- We are at the end of iteration 10
  - Leads: your TPS reports are due tomorrow by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo) for details
  - Iteration 10 goals are on a successive slide
- With the end of iteration 9, all six person groups will have a *phase change*
  - This means new leads and new secretaries
  - And a phase change survey; prompts went out again last night
  - A new phase change will start tomorrow, which means the 9 people who haven't completed them will have to do so *tonight*
- Iteration 8 evaluations were released on Feb 22; you have two weeks to request a re-evaluation
  - The number of unit tests submitted is now part of that evaluation (that was the delay)
- Iteration 9 evaluations will be out asap
- Keep in mind that your CI builds should never be failing
- Don't forget to report your hours!
- Office hours for Bloomfield are M/W/F 11:00-noon, or by appointment
- Lecture scheduling notice: we will have a few Friday meetings at the very end of the semester (the last 2 or 3 Fridays) for our project presentations
  - Currenly scheduled for the Fridays of: April 14th, April 21st, and April 28th
    - The last one is only if needed, which we will know that Wednesday
- We will be holding group work days for the few weeks until the end of iteration 11

## Goals for Iteration 10
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Complete the [code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage)
  - That report should be in a docs/coverage/ directory; the output of your code coverage command is the format we are looking for
  - This is the document deliverable for this iteration
- Ensure the system is at 70% [main code coverage](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage)
  - And update the [code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage) report in the docs/coverage/ directory
- [Javascript code coverage](../slides/12-testing.html#/jscodecoverage) should be at 25% (and update the jscoverage.pdf file)
- Ensure that your other deliverables are up to date, along with your requirements document
  - That's the [deployment plan](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/deployment-plan) and
[installation instructions](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/installation)
- The system must be *fully deployed* on the destination server
  - It's expected that the system will likely not be feature complete at this point
- Submit an 'other' report that contains the URL of the deployed system, as well as credentials that myself and the grad TA can use to log in and see how well it works
  - We won't mess anything up on the deployed system; we'll use the course server to do that...
- Keep in mind that the system must be feature complete by the end of iteration 11, so plan your work accordingly
