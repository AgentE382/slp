- Development is over!  Can't you just smell the upcoming summer vacation???

- We are in the middle of iteration 12; iteration goals are on a successive slide
  - Leads: your weekly reports are due tomorrow by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo) for details
  - With the end of iteration 11, 6 person groups had a phase change (and an end-of-phase survey); the survey prompts have already been sent out
    - The "new project lead" emails haven't gone out yet...
    - Three more people have to complete the survey...
- Iteration 10 evaluations have been released; you have two weeks from 3/20 to request a re-eval
- Iteration 11 evaluations will be out today; you will have two weeks (from today, 4/3) to request a re-eval
- You will still be meeting with the customer & grad TA throughout transition!
- Reminders

## Mid-semester individual evals
- You can view these in the PostEm tab of the course management system
- These are not used *directly* in determining the final course grade
  - We will re-determine things at the end of the semester; that updated one will count in your final grade
  - But it provides a good idea of what we are thinking at this point
- Many of the fields are information stored elsewhere
  - Reported hours, content from the evaluations, etc.
- Other fields can't be determined until the end of the semester
- The most important fields are:
  - unexcused absences
  - iterations without any reported times
  - surveys not completed (although everybody currently has zero here)
  - mid-semester individual rating of the work you are doing
- If anything is wrong, please fill out a regrade (for "Individual spring mid-semester evaluation, spring 2017")
- Pretty much every other field is simply restating information you have seen elsewhere
- I'll pause while you all go look it up...

- We are at the end of iteration 11
  - Leads: your TPS reports are due tomorrow by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo) for details
  - Iteration 11 goals are on a successive slide
- With the end of iteration 11, all six person groups will have a *phase change*
  - This means new leads and new secretaries
  - And a phase change survey; prompts will go out today
- Iteration 9 evaluations have been released; you have two weeks from 3/15 to request a re-eval
  - The test case count will be updated later...
- Iteration 10 evaluations have been released; you have two weeks from 3/20 to request a re-eval
- Keep in mind that your CI builds should never be failing
- Don't forget to report your hours!
- Office hours for Bloomfield are M/W/F 11:00-noon, or by appointment
- Lecture scheduling notice: we will have a few Friday meetings at the very end of the semester (the last 2 or 3 Fridays) for our project presentations

## Mid-semester individual evals
- You can view these in the PostEm tab of the course management system
- These are not used *directly* in determining the final course grade
  - We will re-determine things at the end of the semester; that updated one will count in your final grade
  - But it provides a good idea of what we are thinking at this point
- Many of the fields are information stored elsewhere
  - Reported hours, content from the evaluations, etc.
- Other fields can't be determined until the end of the semester
- The most important fields are:
  - unexcused absences
  - iterations without any reported times
  - surveys not completed (although everybody currently has zero here)
  - mid-semester individual rating of the work you are doing
- If anything is wrong, please fill out a regrade (for "Individual spring mid-semester evaluation, spring 2017")
- Pretty much every other field is simply restating information you have seen elsewhere
- I'll pause while you all go look it up...

## Goals for Iteration 11
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Complete the full transition plan
  - Really this means make any edits or updates to the [master test plan](../slides/12-testing.html#/mastertestplan), [deployment plan](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/deployment-plan), and [installation instructions](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/installation)
  - This is the document deliverable for this iteration; but if those are fully up to date, then there will not be much work to do on this part
- Ensure the system is at 80% [main code coverage](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage)
  - And update the [code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage) report in the docs/coverage/ directory
- [Javascript code coverage](../slides/12-testing.html#/jscodecoverage) should be at 50% (and update the jscoverage.pdf file)
- Note that the system was *fully deployed* on the destination server last iteration
- The system must be *feature complete* (meaning all the minimum and desired requirements) by the end of this iteration
  - It must be running on both the course server as well as the deployment host
- The requirements document must be fully updated and in sync with the deployed system

  - Those without a phase change: sorry for the dupilcates!
- Keep in mind that your CI builds should never be failing
- Don't forget to report your hours!
- Office hours for Bloomfield are M/W/F 11:00-noon, or by appointment
  - But not Wednesday or Friday of this week (CS 2150 exam week)

## Goals for Iteration 7
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Update the requirements document with the work to be done for this semester
  - Since the minimum requirements were done last semester, this should all be under desired requirements
  - But this may need to be adjusted depending on last semester's progress, customer feedback, etc.
- Write the [deployment plan](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/deployment-plan)
  - Enter that as a docs/deployment-plan.md file in the repo
  - This is the document deliverable for this iteration
- Get feedback from the customer about the system, either in person or by email
  - This will be used to edit the requirements document and the github issues
- Edit the github issues to make them as reasonably accurate as you can at this point
- Plan out what to do in the next iteration (include that in the TPS report)
