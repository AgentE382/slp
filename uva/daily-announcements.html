<h4>Migrating Geese</h4>

## Monday, September 5th
- The [frameworks HW](../docs/hw-frameworks.html) is all ready; more on this on the next slide
- We have a VirtualBox Linux image all configured for you
  - The image is on Collab's Resources; also see the [installation
  - Make sure you specify that it's a 64-bit guest!
  - Also see the [installation instructions](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/tutorials/01-intro-unix/virtual-box.html) (from CS 2150's lab 1) and the [image details](../docs/virtualbox-image-details.html)
- Are people having Plasma crash issues?
- Project status (same as last Friday): 12 docs written, 3 meetings scheduled, and 1 more meeting pending
- Unlike CS 2150, I don't care what system you develop on
  - But most (if not all) of the software will be on a LAMP system, so you'll have to use something similar to LAMP.  I've seen people set up Mac OS X to run MAMP, and Windows to run WAMP...
- You can't `sudo` on the course server, so please stop trying
- If you are not registered, please come chat with me after class today, as I have a status update
- Today we will be will be discussing [frameworks](../slides/03-frameworks.html#/)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Homework status
- The [git/github HW due](../docs/hw-git.html) was due last Wednesday
- The [frameworks HW](../docs/hw-frameworks.html) has three parts; the URLs **MUST** match what is listed below:
  - CakePHP, due Mon, 9/5 (end of the day): URL: http://server/~mst3k/cakephp/
    - As long as you put your code in `~/html/cakephp`, it will have that URL
  - Rails, due Fri, 9/9 (end of the day): URL: http://server/rails/mst3k
    - That URL is already configured, as long as your Rails project is in `~/railshw/`
  - Django, due Mon, 9/12 (end of the day): URL: http://server/django/mstek
    - You set this up via the `wsgi-admin` call; we recommend putting it in `~/djangohw/`
- The course server is all configured and ready to go
  - You can find your account info in the Collab Post'Em tool
  - SSH keys: 
    - RSA key fingerprint is 51:c6:7e:a6:44:b3:8e:f9:85:57:e0:7f:fb:c7:20:d3
    - ECDSA key fingerprint is ed:1c:0e:61:94:2c:3f:53:d1:f1:dd:90:9b:f7:cb:a7
  - In theory, you should not require `sudo` to complete anything
- You have three databases that you can use (all use the same password): `mst3k`, `test_mst3k`, and `mst3k_test`
  - Use them however you would like to make the three projects work
  - If you need a fourth to make it work, let me know
- There are a few custom commands on the course server that you can use:
  - `reload-apache2`: reloads the web server
  - `view-apache2-log`: views the apache2 log
  - `wsgi-admin`: to register your Django application
- Each framework has a "getting started" page that is also updated

- There will be 1-2 more HWs each successive week, then the projects start
- We have a VirtualBox Linux image all configured for you
  - The image is on Collab's Resources; also see the [installation
  - Make sure you specify that it's a 64-bit guest!
  - Also see the [installation instructions](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/tutorials/01-intro-unix/virtual-box.html) (from CS 2150's lab 1) and the [image details](../docs/virtualbox-image-details.html)
- Unlike CS 2150, I don't care what system you develop on
  - But most (if not all) of the software will be on a LAMP system, so you'll have to use something similar to LAMP.  I've seen people set up Mac OS X to run MAMP, and Windows to run WAMP...
- Please fill out the github userid survey at http://goo.gl/Vjn3Yx by Wednesday of next week
  - Why don't you do that now?
  - You should have received an email about that
  - I will need that information to get your assignments graded, and to release the project information to you
- Today we will finish the [course introduction](course-introduction-fall.html#/) and start on [development methodologies](../../slides/02-development-methods.html#/)
