# Remaining Work
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What you have to do to get outta here...
- The remaining tasks are all described in this slide set
- Leads must still submit both reports, including a TPS report!
- They include:
  - If you didn't complete the specific tests from iteration 13, they need to be completed!
  - Complete all the [iteration 14 goals](iteration-goals.html#/it14goals), which include:
    - Documentation in the proper format (make sure the file names match!)
    - Github repo clean-up
    - Hand-off to the customer
    - Completion of the surveys
- Please fill out the Collab course evaluations!
- This is all repeated at the [end of this slide set](#/conclusion)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it14goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 14
- Deliverables
  - [Individual tutorial](../../slides/11-deliverables.html#/tutorials) (completed), [Screen shots](../../slides/11-deliverables.html#/screenshots), [One slide version](../../slides/11-deliverables.html#/singleslide)
- You should have submitted everything as specified in the [submission requirements](../../slides/11-deliverables.html#/submission) part of the [deliverables](../../slides/11-deliverables.html#/) slide set
- Testing
  - All tests must pass (including green CI status and being able to run the tests on the course server)
- At the end: end-of-phase AND end-of-year surveys
- Complete your individual journaling prompt
- All github issues and branches trimmed
  - Unless it's an open source project; then have any appropriate issues be zero story points
- Implement any updates, tweaks, UI fixes, or bug fixes found by you or the customer
- [Final presentation](../../slides/11-deliverables.html#/finalpres) to the class (likely done in iteration 13)
- [Final hand-off to the customer](../../slides/11-deliverables.html#/customer)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Documentation
- Your documentation needs to be in a standard format
  - Both so that I can ensure that everything is present, and to help me find things for the customer
- Documents should either be in Markdown or PDF
  - Any documents going to the customer must be in PDF; you can use pandoc (see [later](#/pandoc)) to convert them
    - This includes: user-manual.pdf, installation-instructions.pdf, requirements-document.pdf, and programming-reference.pdf
  - All PDF documents must have the original source
  - If you used Google Docs (or similar), that's fine -- just save a .odt (or whatever) version in the repo
    - We need to be able to generate a nicely formatted PDF from the Google Docs export, however!
  - Make sure the names are *exactly* correct!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Documentation, page 2
- If some of the documenmts are elsewhere in the repo, create a one-line document of the appropriate name that just states where the document can be found
  - This should only (possibly) occur with the programming reference and/or installation instructions
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Document files I will look for
- technical-report.???/pdf
- user-manual.???/pdf
- programming-reference.md
- requirements-document.md
- transition plan: deployment-plan.md, master-test-plan.md, installation-instructions.md
- specific-test-plans.md
- coverage/index.html (and the entire coverage/ directory)
- jscoverage.pdf
- code-coverage-excuses.md (optional; see [here](../../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverageslacking))
- final-presentation.???/pdf
- one-slide.pptx
- screenshot*.png
- readme.md (see [here](../../slides/11-deliverables.html#/readmemd))
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Documentation, continued
- This should all be in the `docs/` directory in your github repo
- An automated script will be looking for all those things, so please follow the naming conventions there
  - And as we are all computer scientists, so let's get the cApItAlIzAtIoN case correct
  - And, really, who puts spaces in file names these days?
- I am happy to "pre-check" all this for you, so that you don't run into any last-minute surprises
  - Just send me an email asking me to check your docs/ directory to make sure everything is correct
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="pandoc"><script type="text/template">
## Documentation, continued, continued
- Note that if any of these documents are LaTeX, put those files in an appropriately named sub-directory
  - i.e., `technical-report/`, `programming-reference/`, etc.
- Otherwise, include the source of any other documents (.docx) along with the .pdf
- You can use pandoc to convert markdown to PDF:
  - Install the package, if it's not already:
```
sudo apt-get install pandoc
```
  - The command to convert it is:
```
pandoc -f markdown --smart -o file.pdf file.md
```
- Docs that need nice formatting (user manual, etc.) cannot be converted from Markdown!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Github repo cleanup
- Your github repo should be in a reasonable state
  - Remember that other people may work on your project
- In particular:
  - Reasonable directory structure
    - Example: if you have a bagillion data files in the root directory (I know who you are!), then put them in a data/ sub-directory
  - All issues either should be resolved, or we have talked about it
    - An open issue means you didn't complete something
    - That being said, you can have future enhancements listed as github issues
    - This doesn't apply to open source projects!  They can (and probably should) have issues remaining.
  - Other than the master branch, any other existing branches should all have a specific purpose (i.e., clean up your branches)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Hand-off to the customer
- This is described more fully [here](../../slides/11-deliverables.html#/customer)
- In particular (but read the full description):
  - Email them thanking them for the whole process
  - Include the appropriate (but not all!) documentation and other attachments, and briefly describe them
  - CC me when you do so
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Completion of the TWO surveys
- One is the usual end-of-phase survey
- The other is a (rather extensive) end-of-year survey
  - One question is whether you would be willing to be contacted in the future for support issues
    - There is no pressure to answer this one way or the other!
  - Incompletes will be issues if either survey is not completed, so please complete them!
    - This does ***NOT*** mean sycophantic, flattering answers!  It means taking the time to write thoughtful responses; more details [here](#/filloutsurveys)
- The survey prompts will be sent out later this week or early next week
- The surveys have that silly timeout issue
  - I'll put the end-of-year survey on Collab for you to look over first
- Both must be completed!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Show stoppers
- Any of the following will prevent the *entire* group from completing this course:
  - Not having all the tests completed and working
    - This includes the specific tests from iteration 13, as well as a green CI status badge
  - Not having cleaned up the github repo
  - Not having the documentation in the correct format
  - Not having handed off the project to the customer
  - Not having completed all the things from the iteration goals from iterations 12, 13, and 14
  - Not having a working system (yes, I have to say that...)
- The following will prevent you, specifically, from completing this course:
  - Not completing the two remaining surveys

## Burndown charts
- Remember I had you estimate all the tasks at the beginning of the year?
- There were many reasons, but one purpose was to illustrate how difficult estimation really is
- Let's compare a sample burndown chart with our charts...

## Lessons learned...
- Estimates are rarely accurate
- Estimation is quite difficult to do
- If this were a paid project, we would have spent much more time on estimation than we did
  - (not that I think *we* should have spent more time...)
  - For a commercial project, a poor estimate can bankrupt a company!
- Generating proper estimates require an experienced person (possibly a consultant)
- We did better this year than in past years!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## The Waterfall Method is Horrible!
- If we had used the waterfall development methodology...
  - There would never have been any requirement changes
  - Customers would not have been necessary to test the system
  - We would have had all the test data up front
  - There would not have been (much) ambiguity as to features
- You can see why companies still like it!
- But also our software would have sucked, so there's that...

# Git and Github
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Github issues
- As of last night, there were 2,226 total issues across all 15 projects
  - Low of 65 for one group, high of 226 for another group
  - This does not count pull requests
- That's about 148 per project, on average
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Git statistics
- As of last night, there were 11,002 total commits for all 15 projects
  - Low of 374 for one group, high of 1,354
  - This is for all branches, and includes merge commits
- That's about 733 commits per group, on average
  - Last year's average was 719, so it's pretty close to that!
    - The year before was 726
  - About 52 commits per iteration (51 last year, 52 the year before)
  - About 8 commits per person per iteration (8 last year)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Git observations
- Only 164 commits resolved (or closed or fixed) an issue via a commit message
  - Out of 11,002 commit messages, that's only 1.5%
  - Out of 1,086 total issues, that's 7.4%
- Some commit messages follow
  - Note that none of these offend me, so don't feel stressed if your commit message is on here
  - In fact, I found (most of) them rather humorous

# Hours
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Disclaimer
- Again, as the current iteration (#14) is not yet complete, the data for the following slides is thus also not yet complete
- What follows are the *reported* hours, which I know is not the same as *actual* hours.  But it's all I have to go by...
- Some groups had people drop out, which affect the totals on the next page
- So take it with a big grain of salt...
	  </script></section>

<!-- queries:

mysql> select sum(hours), project_id, (select title from projects where projects.id=project_id) as name from time_cards, roles where roles.user_id=time_cards.user_id  and project_id>=40 group by project_id;

mysql> select sum(hours) from time_cards, roles where roles.user_id=time_cards.user_id  and project_id>=40;

-->

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## I have kept my word...

The numerical amount of hours you submitted has never, and will never, be used as a factor in your grade
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Reported hours analysis
- Total was 8,379 hours
- Average was 559 hours per group
  - Previous years: 634, 674, 657
- Which is 39.9 hours per (two-week) iteration
- Which is 6.1 hours per student per (two-week) iteration
- Which is 3.05 hours per student per week
- At $100 per hour (a reasonable consulting rate), that's $55,900 "given" to the community per project
- Or $837,900 overall (almost a million dollars!)
- Even if we charge half that, it's still a very significant sum
	  </script></section>

<!-- To obtain the data for the next slide:

- Generated the reported times table via the user interface; keep in mind that this produces data from 15 iterations
- Ensure that the dropped students from the spring no longer have a 'role' entry
- Query (change the project_id range):

select * from reported_times where user_id in(select roles.user_id from roles where project_id>=30 and role='student') and count=0 and count_late=0 and iteration_num<15;

- remove ' and count=0 and count_late=0' to get *all* of the iterations (should be n*14, where n is the number of students in the course)

-->

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Can we do better?
- 150 (of 14*91 = 1,274) iterations did not have any hours reported
  - Due to not entering hours; entering zero hours is not counted here
  - 60 of those are from the current iteration 14, which has not been required to be reported yet
- Can we assume that those iterations had work done?  Sure, why not
  - Some of those are from people who totally slacked off, but others (I know) did not report all their hours; but we'll scale it down all the same
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Can we do better?
- 150 of 1,274 iterations had no hours reported
- 150/1274 = 11.7%, which we'll scale down to 10%
  - So we can increase all our estimates by that much
- That yields $61,490 given per project (round to $60k)
- And $921,690 overall (round to $920k)

## What didn't work well
- The increased load on the teaching faculty meant I could not prepare as many lectures as I had intended
- The large course size meant I could not follow the projects as closely as I would have liked
- Having some of the class not continue from the fall to the spring

## What did work well
- We developed 15 projects for the customers!
  - And it seems that most, if not all, of them will be used by the nonprofits
- All three platforms were well received and (generally) bug free
- Better course structure allowed the projects to be kept on track better than in previous years
- Having a grad TA really helped everything move along smoothly
  - And having an undergrad TA was great to help develop some course tools!
- The course management system helped keep things organized
- You (hopefully) gained some real-world experience

## Changes for next year
- I estimate over 100 students (up from about 91 this year)
- A journaling entry (and occassional reading) every iteration
- All new projects!  Probably about 17 or so.
- Likely one new platform, and updated versions of the existing ones
- More lectures, especially during the spring
- More use of existing online tools
- I am on sabbatical in the spring
  - Prof Ibrahim and I will co-teach in the fall, and he will take over in the spring
  - Presumably, we will both be back teaching it the next fall (of 2018)

## Final exam grade
- In addition to the tutorial, it is partly based on your completion of the end-of-year survey
- I'm not looking for sycophantic answers!
  - I'm looking for your honest opinions
  - And I want constructive criticism, as that is what will help me improve the SLP
- I'm going to be looking that you:
  - Completed the survey
  - Took time to respond to (some, if not all) of the fill-in questions
- Please don't add fluff or flattery or anything else like that; it just wastes both our times

## What is left for you to do
- Leads: fill out your weekly report today, and your TPS reports next Monday
