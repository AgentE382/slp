## Tutorials
- These are in lieu of a final exam
- Details can be found [here](../../slides/spring/02-deliverables.html#/tutorials)
- They are due by the end of the normal final exam period (Mon, May 4th @ 5 p.m.)
- Note that there is a ***GRADE DIFFERENCE*** depending on if you are creating a new tutorial or converting an old tutorial
  - We don't have as many old tutorials to covert (only 43)
  - So you only have to convert 1 (as opposed to 2 from last semester)
  - However, if you convert tutorials, your grade is capped out at 60% of the maximum
    - This is partly because it's a much easier task, but also to encourage people to write new tutorials
  - I am happy to chat about potential new tutorial topics
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="grades2"><script type="text/template">
## Course grades
- The details for what is being graded can be found [here](#/grades)
- The weighting will likely not be known until right before the final grades are determined and submitted
  - Mostly because it's not really possible to estimate what the final weighting will be
- However, I will post all the criteria used to determine the final grades via Collab's PostEm tool
  - You will have a day or two to look it over and register any concerns or complaints
- I will then use my [Magic 8-ball](http://www.indra.com/8ball/front.html), and determine the final grades

## Course Grading Metric
- This is quite similar to what was used last semester, and follows what was dicussed in the [course introduction](../../slides/fall/01-intro.html#/grades) last August
  - The intent is to have grades released to you a few days before I turn them in so that you can vent your wrath at me
- The base grade is group-based:
  - Results of the evaluations of the iterations
  - Customer and instructor evaluation of the final system
    - The customer evaluations are taken with an appropriate grain of salt
  - Deliverables evaluation
- This is modified by a *factor* based on how much work we felt you did for the project (below average, average, above average, etc.)
- There are some individual components (tutorial for the final, for example)
- Penalties for attendance, not filling out surveys, not reporting hours, wearing mismatched socks, etc.
- It is calibrated so that all "good" evlauations with an average amount of work will yield an A

- Deliverables for iteration 12: code coverage up to 100%, user manual (draft), specific test plans (written), STS technical report (draft or outline)
  - These need to be quality drafts -- throwing together something at the last minute because you have senioritis will just make me really cranky
- We will be doing tutorials again in lieu of a final exam
  - So start thinking about topics!
  - The mechanism to reserve them is not yet ready...

## Github Story Points<br>Hall of Shame

Remember that *all* issues (even closed ones) must have a story points tag.  The following do not:

&nbsp;

- Haven: issue #129
- Shelter: issue #160

&nbsp;

You can give a tag of "story-points-none" if the task is not worth any story points

- We are half-way through iteration 12: transition!
  - 6 person groups just had a phase change last week; the survey prompt reminder was sent out last night
- Leads: your weekly reports are due tomorrow by noon; details [here](../../slides/fall/01-intro.html#/weeklyreport)
  - Everybody can view the submitted reports through the [reporting system](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/slp/)
- There was a delay allowed for the 90% testing code coverage; that delay is one week (i.e., until the end of next Monday)
  - Really we are just going to look if you hit 100% by the end of the current iteration
- Note that we must be able to run the unit tests on the course server!
  - We were unable to do so on some of the groups' accounts
- My office hours are M/W 1:30-3:00, but not this Wednesday unless we chat about it
- Customer meetings in 1 line: reports (1 sentence) but not w/Jamie; name tags
- Don't forget to report your hours!!! This is a course requirement!
- Today is a group work day

## Transition Period Overview
- <font color='red'>YOUR CUSTOMER MUST BE USING THE SYSTEM!!!</font>
  - If not, and you and I are not in discussion about this, it will be considered a failure to properly deploy the system -- which means you will not have completed the entire point of this course
  - I will be emailing all the customers later this week to remind them to use the system
- There are many deliverables due during the transition period (described next)
- You must still be "tweaking" your system: implementing any fixes (or minor changes) that the customer requests

## Schedule changes moving forward
- As mentioned on the first day of the spring semester, there will only be Wednesday lectures for about the first half of the semester
  - We've largely hit that point
  - There isn't much I can lecture to you about that:
    1. Will be of use to you as you wrap up your projects, and
    2. Won't be a waste of your time
- There is one more definite lecture ([maintenance](../../slides/spring/04-maintenance.html)), as well as a few other things: guest talk, course conclusions, presentations etc.
- But most of the following Wednesdays will now become group work days
  - Thus, there will be two group work days each week: Mondays and Wednesdays

## Master Test Plan versus Code Coverage Report
- The original idea, as presented in the [deliverables slide set](../../slides/spring/02-deliverables.html), was to submit the [code coverage report](../../slides/spring/03-testing.html#/codecoverage) instead of the [master test plan](../../slides/spring/03-testing.html#/mastertestplan) this iteration
  - I sneakily changed it; the reason was to give you more time to write your unit tests for the code coverage report
- Some have asked that that order be reversed
- That's fine, with the following caveats:
  - If you are submitting the code coverage report this iteration, then you *still* need to submit a `docs/master-test-plan.md` (or .pdf) file that has one line: "we are submitting the code coverage report this iteration instead"
    - This way we know you didn't forget
  - You still need to hit the 80% target for code coverage

  - The system needs to be fully deployed, to the deployment host, at the end of the development phase (March 23rd)

    - Whatever the current state is at that point
  - I just wanted to give you a heads-up so it does not come as a surprise later on...
- My office hours are M/W 1:30-3:00

## Server hack
- The [ZmEu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZmEu_%28vulnerability_scanner%29) malware succesfully attacked the course server on Monday, February 9th
  - It likely got access through a weak password in phpmyadmin
  - From there, a vulnerability in phpmyadmin allowed console access
- Even though the system was fully updated, the installed version of phpmyadmin (4.0.10) is well below the most recent version (4.3.9)
  - It's unclear if the exploit was a weak password or a bug in phpmyadmin that has since been fixed
- The server was allowed to be reconnected to the network this morning
  - Assuming the malware was properly removed, it should stay up for the foreseeable future
- Some of your processess - and all of your login shells -- were terminated as a result of all of this
- Consequence: phpmyadmin has been disabled
  - And likely will not be enabled again this semester
  - You will have to use the command-line mysql client

## Github Story Points<br>Hall of Shame

Remember that *all* issues (even closed ones) must have a story points tag.  The following do not:

- No one!  w00t!

You can give a tag of "story-points-none" if the task is not worth any story points

## Deployment plan
- Due at the end of iteration 7 (January 26th)
- So that we can find it, please make a `docs/` directory in the root of your github repo, and put it there (in PDF or Markdown format)
- It should contain:
  - Where the system is being deployed (URL, provider, etc.)
    - Alternatively: AWS, Heroku, customer's machine, etc.
  - What "things" need to be acquired for said deployment
    - Servers? Domain names? Hosting accounts?  Credentials?
  - Acknowledgement from the customer that s/he will need to acquire those "things"
    - This can be an e-mail separate from the deployment plan
    - You should start an email conversation with the customer about all this; said email conversation is likely sufficient
    - And a rough timeline for the acquisition of said "things"
- A single paragraph is fine, if that covers everything
- You should also include whatever indicators you have that the customer understands that s/he will have to acquire this, if appropriate
