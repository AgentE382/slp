## Monday, December 7th, 2015
- We are in the middle of iteration 6 (day 7)
  - Leads: your weekly reports are due tomorrow by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo) for details
- CS 4971 in the spring: 10 a.m. in THN E303 (good time, bad room)
  - Don't take too long to enroll via SIS...
- Iteration 5 evaluations are out; as are the iteration 3 individual evals (more on this in a bit)
  - Note that if you have concerns about the individual evals, you should submit a regrade soon!
- We will not be having a final project in lieu of a final; nor will we meet here during the final exam time
- Reminders (all done via the [course administration tool](https://slp.cs.virginia.edu/admin))
  - Don't forget to report your hours!  This is a course requirement
  - Submit meeting reports whenever you meet with a customer (but not with the grad TA)
  - Group meetings: take notes (can be back-dated via putting the date in the title)
  - If you miss class for a *valid* reason, please submit an excuse for that day
- Repo you have access to: [uva-slp/tutorials](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials); while some may be outdated, many will be *quite* useful, such as setting up your dev platform
- Please fill out the course evaluations!!!
- Today is a group work day
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it6goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 6
- Complete 24 / 28 / 32 story points worth of stuff
- Get customer feedback on the preliminary system (from the last iteration), and iterate on that design
- Complete the final system that implements the minimum requirements, and have it working on the course server
- Have the customer start using and testing the system via an email, CC'ed to me, that requests that they start testing the sytsem over break
  - Also mention that you'll likely be out of contact until mid-January
- Complete a preliminary *deployment plan*: a Markdown document in your repo as docs/deployment-plan.md that has all the known deployment info
- Everybody should complete 5 more unit tests
  - This means you should have at least 15 unit tests per team member
- Meet with the grad TA and demo your final system
  - If the meeting time is doing to cause scheduling issues (during a final, after you've left grounds, etc.), you can request a different time to meet
  - If you meeting is early in the iteration, it's fine if some functionality is not yet finished; we can check that when it's all done
- Individual tasks
  - Complete the individual project that is in lieu of the final exam
  - Upload your STS prospectus (if you are using this class for STS 4500)
  - At the very end, complete the end-of-phase survey
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Individual Evaluations
- They have been released through Collab's Post'Em tool, and are through iteration 3
  - Sorry they are a bit late!
- What is posted is the list of *metrics* that will be used to compute your final grades
- Let's review the [grading policy](course-introduction-fall.html#/grades)...
- The *individual rating of the work you are doing* is an estimate of just that, and will affect your final grade
- Many of the metrics have you look at the evals for more details
  - At the end of the semester, they will be merged into this sheet
- There are a few things there that should be corrected, if a mistake was made in transcription (only)
  - Iterations with no git commits
  - Missing surveys (this is *very* bad); note that they cannot be taken late
  - A mistake in us estimating how much work you have done
    - You will have to provide evidence that we mis-estimated this
- Note that this is merely a snapshot of how things were at the end of iteration 3, and may very well change by the end of the semester
- If there is something wrong, please submit a regrade via the course administration tool
	  </script></section>

  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Updated things to be completed this semester
- Finish development through iteration 6
  - You should have the minimum requirements fully completed and working
  - This means that your CI testing status should be green!
- Everybody should continue to report your hours
- Leads: submit your weekly report (tomorrow) and TPS report (next week)
- Email your customer to start using the system (and CC me)
- Complete the last end-of-phase survey (released on Sun, Dec 13)
- Have your final group meeting/presentation with the grad TA
- Upload your STS prospectus (if you are using SLP for your technical project)

&nbsp;

Note that you will receive an incomplete if any of these things are not done when I submit the final grades!
  </script></section>

  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Holiday Break
- I will do my best not to bother you until we return.  But...
- If something goes wrong with the system, or the customer can't use it, then I'll start sending emails
- The customer may (or may not) email you
- My hope is that I don't have to contact anybody (I want a break from course work too...)
  </script></section>

  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Preview of next semester
- There will be 8 iterations instead of 6
  - The first 5 will be development; the last 3 deployment
  - Different group sizes will have a different phase schedule as a result
  - Desired requirements are due by March 23rd, 2015 (the end of iteration 11)
- Iterations will have specific deliverables
  - Deployment plan, test plan, transition plan, etc.
- Some documentation during the last 3 iterations
  - Technical report, user manual, installation instructions, programming reference
  - I will guide you through all of these
- And, of course, lots of progress on your projects!

- We are in the middle of iteration 4 (day 9)
  - Leads: your weekly reports were due yesterday by noon
- Course server stuff (CNAME for URLs, installing packages, etc.)
- CS 4971 in the spring: 10 a.m. in THN E303 (good time, bad room)
- Iteration 3 evaluations are out (but not the individual ones yet)
  - As we have completed half of our iterations (3 of 6), there will be an individual evaluation as well; this should be out within a few days
- Reminders (all done via the [course administration tool](https://slp.cs.virginia.edu/admin))
  - Don't forget to report your hours!  This is a course requirement
  - Also, please don't forget to submit meeting reports whenever you meet with a customer (but don't do this with the meetings with the grad TA)
  - Likewise, all group meetings need to have notes taken
    - You can back-date meeting notes, if necessary (via stating so in the title)
  - If you miss class for a *valid* reason, please submit an excuse for that day to prevent you from being marked absent
- New repo you have access to: [uva-slp/tutorials](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials); while some may be outdated, many will be *quite* useful, such as setting up your dev platform
- I was not planning on having office hours today unless requested...
- Today is a group work day.  Wait, what?

## Goals for Iteration 4
- Complete 24 / 28 / 32 story points worth of stuff
- Everybody should complete 5 more unit tests
  - You don't need to also do a fixture, as long as you did one in the last iteration
  - This means you should have about 10 unit tests per team member
- The wireframes should be (presumably) finalized, and likely implemented, by the end of this iteration
  - Please still keep copies in the docs/wireframes directory in your repo!
- As the iterations continue, there will be fewer specific requirements (other than "do work" and "write tests")

## STS 4500 Issues
- I have to sign all of your prospectii
  - As this is an STS requirement, I will blindly sign your title page without looking at the prospectus itself
    - Although I may ask you what percentage of fluff is in the document
  - DO NOT PRINT OUT THE ENTIRE PROSPECTUS FOR ME!  I don't want a hard copy.  I'm not going to read it.
    - I do read your technical report in the spring (and I comment on it)
  - Just print out your copy (or just the title page) for me to sign
- After Thanksgiving, I'll bring in my signature stamp (and my date stamp!) to the group work days to sign all of them
  - Please don't slide it under my door; I'll sign it in class
- You will have to upload the prospectus (in PDF form) to the [course administration tool](https://slp.cs.virginia.edu/admin)
  - This can be done at any time, once it's completed
  - Please just name it "prospectus.pdf"
  - I'll check, at the end of the semester, who didn't upload them, and send them a reminder to do so

  - Two people have not and I'm getting cranky.
- Course server stuff (CNAME for URLs, installing packages, etc.)

- Iteration 2 evaluations released late last week -- please look them over!

## A question about the course structure
- Two of the surveys requested that the information for this class be presented in a different manner
  - Calendar, schedule, etc.
- What would help the most?
- Some thoughts...
  - A calendar would just have the list of iterations (found [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/itlist)) and phases (found [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/phlist))
    - Should I make those links more prominent? I can put them on the [SLP: UVa](index.html) page
  - The current iteration goals are always listed in each day's daily announcements
    - In general, I aim to make *all* the things-to-be-remembered available in the most recent day's daily announcements
  - I could have a what-is-due-when for a given iteration, but it really is just two things:
    - When the three types of reports are due (found [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo))
    - All the stuff that is due at the end (the [iteration goals](iteration-goals.html#/) and the reporting of hours)
- So what would help the most?
  - Feel free to email me later or leave me [anonymous feedback](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/site/abd4c720-2e1c-4e78-ba51-747402696f40/page/c4420ab7-347c-42df-beef-39869b8179a2) about this

## Today's task
- Today we will be working on the CI testing setup
- No groups are fully there yet (which is fine, since it's due at the end of the iteration)
  - 5 (of 9) groups have passing builds, but nobody has a significant number of their unit tests written yet
  - In addition, recall that each *person* must contribute at least 5 valid test cases (and one fixture per person)
- To do today:
  - Get Travis or Circle configured for your project
  - Extensive instructions for how to configure it (as well as sample configured projects) are available: the [CI testing slide set](../../slides/09-ci-testing.html), the [CI setup](../../docs/ci-setup.html) page, and two sample configured repos ([cake3-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/cake3-test) and [django-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/django-test))
  - Contribute the desired number of unit tests (at least 5 per person)
- At the end of today, all the build status badges should be green!

## End of phase survey
- Everybody has to fill it out!  It's a course requirement
- We went over it on Monday
- It should take about 10 minutes to complete
- The same survey will be completed after each phase
  - So you will have to complete as many as there are members in your group
- You can see the questions asked [here][5] (it's in Collab, under Resources/surveys/end_of_phase); it has pages [1][1], [2][2], [3][3], and [4][4]
- There is about a week-long period to fill it out
- You will receive a survey prompt in a day or so, as well as increasingly anxious reminders
- There is a *timeout* issue with regard to filling out surveys
  - LimeSurvey (the survey tool being used) will time you out after 10 (or so) minutes -- and then you'll have to start over!
  - So, if you want to spend time thinking about the responses, look over the survey in Collab first!
  - If you do get timed out, I can send you your previouslly completed responses

## Goals for Iteration 3
- Complete 24 / 28 / 32 story points worth of stuff
  - Some of this will be the work done on the wireframing, some will be the work done on the CI testing
  - Your site should have significnantly more functionality than last time
- Show the wireframe to the customer, get their feedback, iterate on the design
- You will have to configure your site with one of two CI servers: [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/) or [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
  - The [last two slides](../../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/howtobegin) of the [Continuous Integration Testing](../../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/) slide set discuss how to begin
  - Each group was assigned to one or the other; assignments are [here](../../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/assignments)
  - The respective CI server is already set up to run tests on your repo on every push
  - Yout have to write the configuration file to get it to work properly
  - Extensive instructions for how to configure it (as well as sample configured projects) are available: the [CI testing slide set](../../slides/09-ci-testing.html), the [CI setup](../../docs/ci-setup.html) page, and two sample configured repos ([cake3-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/cake3-test) and [django-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/django-test))
    - Because nobody is using Rails, the rails-test repo was not updated this year, and is not being made available
- You will have to write a number of unit tests (at least 5 per person)
  - And one fixture each!

## Goals for iteration 2
- Have a site that should start to look like a workable site for the requirements
  - Some just had one or two MVC components for the first iteration (which was fine, as that is what was required for then)
- Complete 24 / 28 / 32 story points worth of "stuff" (depending on group size)
- Your regular iteration meeting with the customer and the grad TA should happen
- Specific goals:
  - Generate wireframes: that's in the [wireframes](../../slides/08-wireframing.html#/) lecture; this will likely take 3 or 5 story points of work.  The intent is to show them to the customer in iteration 3
  - Enable easy deployment via automatic logins or ssh keys: see the [Development Environment Setup page](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/docs/dev-env-setup.html) for details.  This also includes enabling easy downloading of the database
  - Publishing to the course server is best done via a github web hook and deploy key; see [that same page](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/docs/dev-env-setup.html) for details, but only I can set up both of those due to the github security setup
  - Ensure that *everybody* in the development group can develop on his/her own machine
- Some things to keep in mind:
  - Your requrements document will be iterated on throughout the year
  - What format you keep it in is up to you (although we recommend markdown), but we need to be able to view it
  - Having the source (from the [uva-slp/projects repo](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects) repo) copied into a `docs/` directory in your repo is quite reasonable

## Goals for iteration 3
- We will go over these in more detail on Wednesday; this is just a preview

- Wednesday's lecture will be on [continuous integration testing](../../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/)
  - Although that slide set is not quite ready yet...
  - The following Wednesday will be a CI testing workday instead of a lecture
- You will have to configure your site with one of two CI servers: [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/) or [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
  - Each group will be assigned to one or the other
  - Extensive instructions for how to configure it (as well as a sample configured project) will be provided
- Does anybody have a preference as to one service or the other?
  - If so, please email me, and I will try to accommodate it
  - Otherwise, I will balance out the groups between the two CI servers
- You will have to write a number of unit tests (at least 5 per person)
  - And one fixture each!
- And the normal 24 / 28 / 32 story points worth of "stuff"

## Goals for iteration 1
See [here](../../slides/05-project-start.html#/it1goals) for full details, but briefly:

- Fully understand the requirements
- Meet with the customer
- Design (and implement) a basic DB schema
- Get your dev environment set up (see [uva-slp/tutorails](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) for guidance)
- Get a basic MVC site working on the course server
  - Once done, this will require you emailing me so that I can complete the apache2 configuration
- Have the system stored properly in the github repo (no passwords!!!)
- Enter all the requirements as tasks as Github issues (this is next Wednesday)
- Everybody MUST have a github commit this iteration (and, in general, every iteration)

## Monday, September 28th, 2015, part 1
- We are at half-way through iteration 1 (day 7)
  - Leads: your weekly reports are due tomorrow by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo) for details
- The frameworks homeworks are all graded
  - You can view them in the [course administration tool][1]
  - Regrades must be submitted within two weeks (by the end of the day on Monday, October 12th)
  - We are still working on the git/github homework
- Don't forget to report your hours!  This is a course requirement, and done through the [course administration tool][1]
- You *MUST* submit meeting reports, through the [course administration tool][1], whenever you meet with a customer 
  - Some groups didn't do this last week; please do so now...
- Likewise, *all* group meetings need to have notes taken in the [course administration tool][1]
  - You can back-date meeting notes, if necessary
- If you are *NOT* meeting with the customer during the first iteration, please speak to me
- Did I mention that we have a [course administration tool][1]?

## Monday, September 28th, 2015, part 2
- Once your system is up and running, you will need to email me so I can configure the apache webserver
  - Please don't assume that I will be able to guess when it's ready!
  - And I'm not going to handle this at the very last minute!
  - CakePHP should have the site working through http://server/~tag; Django via http://server/django/tag
  - I'll then standardize the URL to http://server/tag (no tilde, no "django")
  - When sending it to the customers, you should use CNAME instead of the server name; internally, you can use either
- New repo you have access to: [uva-slp/tutorials](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials)
  - While some may be outdated, many will be *quite* useful, such as setting up your dev platform
- We have the [legal agreement](legal.html) to be signed today
- Today are group meetings (and grad TA meeting scheduling)
  - Wednesday will be a lecture on [estimation](../../slides/07-estimation.html#/)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Goals for iteration 1
See [here](../../slides/05-project-start.html#/it1goals) for full details, but briefly:

- Fully understand the requirements
- Meet with the customer
- Design (and implement) a basic DB schema
- Get your dev environment set up (see [uva-slp/tutorails](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) for guidance)
- Get a basic MVC site working on the course server
  - Once done, this will require you emailing me so that I can complete the apache2 configuration
- Have the system stored properly in the github repo (no passwords!!!)
- Enter all the requirements as tasks as Github issues (this is next Wednesday)
- Everybody MUST have a github commit this iteration (and, in general, every iteration)

## [Center for Open Science](http://cos.io) project
- This project was added very late
  - Partly due to a late realization that it could work in the context of this course
  - And partly due to another project's cancellation
- We don't yet have the description for the project
- So I wasn't sure what to do:
  - Hold off on releasing the survey until the project description is ready
  - Or release the survey now, and talk, at a high level, about the project
- I decided to do the latter...
- THIS WILL BE AN APACHE 2.0 LICENSE PROJECT!!!
  - You will have to sign a form agreeing to release your code under this license
  - Feel free to select any of the other projects, as they don't have licensing restrictions

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Preferences survey
- An email prompt will be sent to you later today
- An overview of the survey can be found in Collab (in [Resources/surveys/year-start][0])
  - Specifically, pages [1][1], [2][2], [3][3], and [4][4] 
- It must be filled out by the end of the day on Friday
  - This is a <strong class="red">HARD DEADLINE!</strong>
- We'll go over the survey today
- Be aware of the timeout issue!
  - LimeSurvey (the survey tool being used) will time you out after 10 (or so) minutes
    - And then you'll have to start over!
  - So, if you want to spend time thinking about the responses, look over the survey in Collab first!

## Preferences survey hints
- If you really want to work with somebody...
  - You should both list each other as BFFs
  - And ensure that you have similar preferences for things
  - I can't guarantee that, of course
- If you have a group that wants to work together...
  - Everybody should list everybody else as BFFs
  - You need to be VERY flexbile in the project and platform
  - Mention, in the comments at the end of page 4, that you want to work as a group
- If you list too many constraints (too many BFFs, too many mortal enemies, etc.), the problem is just too overconstrained, and I will ignore your input

## Friday, August 28th, 2015
- The [first homework, on git and github](../../docs/hw-git.html), is out; it's due next Friday (Sep 4th) by the start of lecture (12 noon)

  - You have to allow `aaronbloomfield` and `wasiuva` to be Collaborators on any private repos you create for this assignment, but *after* you complete the homework!
- There will be 1-2 more HWs each successive week, then the projects start
- We have a VirtualBox Linux image all configured for you

  - Be aware that VirtualBox version 5.0 and above does NOT work; instead, install the latest 4.3 version
- Unlike CS 2150, I don't care what system you develop on
  - But most (if not all) of the software will be on a LAMP system, so you'll have to use something similar to LAMP.  I've seen people set up Mac OS X to run MAMP, and Windows to run WAMP...
- Please fill out the [github userid survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sXO8Ha1fM2EH39Pq1fYeKz8CyYi3tRfMMU0hYF8TjYw/viewform) by Friday of next week
