## Wednesday, December 3rd, 2014
- We are at the start of iteration 6
- Customer meetings in 1 line: reports (1 sentence) but not w/Jamie; name tags
- Everybody got their TPS reports submitted!
  - Everybody can view the submitted reports through the [reporting system](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/slp/)
  - Details can be found in the [course introduction slide set](../../slides/fall/01-intro.html), specifically [here](../../slides/fall/01-intro.html#tpsreport)
- If your system requires authentication (as most will, eventually), you need to create accounts (of all user levels) for Jamie and myself
- Don't forget to report your hours!!! This is a course requirement!
- Iteration evaluations out through iteration 4
  - Please read it over, as many received poor progress ratings because I couldn't log in or find the work that was done
  - Once that is fixed, come see me (for iteration 2) or Jamie (for the other iteraitons) during office hours or the meeting, and we will re-do the evaluation
- We expect iteration 5 evaluations to be out next Monday
  - Iteration 6 will be slightly different, as there will be an end of the semester evaluation in lieu of iteration 6's evaluation
- It is *very bad* of your CI testing does not work
- Today is a group work day, and our last class meeting until January 12th
  </script></section>

  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Final Projects: Tutorials
- The project is to write a tutorial on *something* that you had to work through this semester
  - Something that, if you had had a tutorial ahead of time, would have saved you time or effort
  - It must be something that there does not exist a tutorial already online
- They are due at the end of the normal final exam period (Mon, Dec 15 @ noon)
- Everybody will have to one (individually) or convert two (from an older format)
  - Note that conversion means making sure that it still works!
- The format will be [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)
  - There is a repo that everybody will fork: [uva-slp/tutorials](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials)
    - You may want to unwatch it to avoid receiving all the notifications...
  - The [README.md](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials/blob/master/README.md) contains instructions for topic reservation and how to complete the tutorial (which is dine via a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/))
- This is meant to take about 3 hours, which is the time a final exam would take
- This will count in lieu of your final exam, which will be a non-insignificant part of your final grade
- In an effort to keep this sane for us, will are going to insist that you please follow the directions laid out in that tutorial
  </script></section>

  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Upcoming Iteration Goals
- Future iterations this semester will have fewer explicit goals
- For all iterations, you should pick 24 or 28 story points worth of "stuff" to do; pick the highest priority stuff!
- Some specific iteration goals follow:
  - Iteration 3: show the wireframe to the customer, get their feedback, iterate on the design
  - Iteration 4: implement continuous integration testing
    - See the details in the [Continuous Integration Testing](../../slides/fall/11-ci-testing.html) slide set
  - Iteration 5: get a preliminary system that implements the minimum requirements working
    - This means that most (if not all) of your minimum requirements should be implemented!
  - Iteration 6: get a final system that implements the minimum requirements working
- Keep in mind that iteration 6's goal is what you are working toward this entire semester!
  </script></section>

  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Updated things to be completed this semester
- Finish development through iteration 6
  - This means that your CI testing had better be green!
- Everybody should continue to report your hours
- Leads: submit your weekly and TPS reports on the next two Mondays
- Email your customer to start using the system
  - More info on this from me soon; you will also have to CC me on that
- Complete your tutorial(s) and submit via a pull request
- Complete the last end-of-phase survey (released on Sun, Dec 14)
- Have your final group meeting/presentation with Jamie (details to follow)
- Upload your STS prospectus (if you are using SLP for your technical project)
  - Last night I emailed all those who have not yet done so

&nbsp;

Note that you will receive an incomplete if any of these things are not done when I submit the final grades!

## Github Story Points<br>Hall of Shame

Remember that *all* issues (even closed ones) must have a story points tag.  The following do not:

&nbsp;

- Alzheimers: issue #103
- Hope's Legacy: issue #291

&nbsp;

You can give a tag of "story-points-none" if the task is not worth any story points
  </script></section>

  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Holiday Break
- I will do my best not to bother you until we return.  But...
- If something goes wrong with the system, or the customer can't use it, then I'll start sending emails
- The customer may (or may not) email you
  - In the directions for the "hand-off", I'll suggest a way to phrase it so that they give you all of their comments once you return
- My hope is that I don't have to contact anybody (I want a break from course work too...)
  </script></section>

  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Preview of next semester
- There will be 8 iterations instead of 6
  - The first 5 will be development; the last 3 deployment
  - 6 and 7 person groups will have a different phase schedule as a result
  - Desired requirements are due by March 23rd, 2015 (the end of iteration 11)
- Iterations will have specific deliverables
  - Deployment plan, test plan, transition plan, etc.
- Some documentation during the last 3 iterations
  - Technical report, user manual, installation instructions, programming reference
  - I will guide you through all of these
- And, of course, lots of progress on your projects!

## Wait, you already had tutorials???
- Well, yes, technically
- But they were either:
  - For a different API version (CakePHP's tutorials were all prior to the 3.0 API; Rails' tutorials were for a different version also)
  - Not for the desired language (no Django tutorials)
  - Mostly for things in Ruby that were either covered by the intro tutorial or things people have not yet gotten to
- And they are in all different formats, and most are outdated
- That's why they haven't been released until now...

## Today's task
- Today we will be working on the CI testing setup
- Only one group is fully there yet (which is fine, since it's due at the end of the iteration)
  - 7 groups have passing builds, but only one of those seven have all the unit tests configured
  - Recall that each *person* must contribute at least 5 valid test cases (and one fixture per person)
- To do today:
  - Get Travis or Circle configured for your project; see the [CI testing](../../slides/fall/11-ci-testing.html) slide set for details
  - Contribute the desired number of unit tests (at least 5 per person)
- At the end of today, all the build status badges should be green!

## Monday, November 10th, 2014
- We are one week into iteration 4
- Customer meetings: don't forget to submit the meeting report when you have met with them!  And wear those nifty name tags.
- Leads: your weekly reports are due tomorrow by noon
  - Everybody can view the submitted reports through the [reporting system](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/slp/)
  - Details can be found in the [course introduction slide set](../../slides/fall/01-intro.html), specifically [here](../../slides/fall/01-intro.html#weeklyreport)
- The meeting reports should only be 1 sentence!  And no need to mention meetings with Jamie
- If your system requires authentication (as most will, eventually), you need to create accounts (of all user levels) for Jamie and myself
- Don't forget to report your hours!!! This is a course requirement!
- Iteration evaluations out through iteration 3 (which was just released last night)
  - Please read it over, as many received poor progress ratings because I couldn't log in or find the work that was done
  - Once that is fixed, come see me (for iteration 2) or Jamie (for iteraitons 1 and 3) during office hours or the meeting, and we will re-do the evaluation
- Today is a group meeting day
  </script></section>

  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Upcoming Iteration Goals
- Future iterations this semester will have fewer explicit goals
- For all iterations, you should pick 24 or 28 story points worth of "stuff" to do; pick the highest priority stuff!
- Some specific iteration goals follow:
  - Iteration 3: show the wireframe to the customer, get their feedback, iterate on the design
  - Iteration 4: implement continuous integration testing
    - See the details in the [Continuous Integration Testing](../../slides/fall/11-ci-testing.html) slide set
  - Iteration 5: get a preliminary system that implements the minimum requirements working
  - Iteration 6: get a final system that implements the minimum requirements working
- Keep in mind that iteration 6's goal is what you are working toward this entire semester!

## Github Story Points<br>Hall of Shame

Remember that *all* issues (even closed ones) must have a story points tag.  The following do not:

&nbsp;

- jaunt: issues 60 and 63
- haven: issues 9, 13, 22, 31, and 47
- shelter: issues 26, 29, 36, 38, 41, and 47

&nbsp;

You can give a tag of "story-points-none" if the task is not worth any story points

## Today's Task
- Today we are going to investigate whether an online tool, [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com) (https://www.pivotaltracker.com) would be worth using for our projects
  - Before having all of you to use it, I want your opinion as to whether it would be useful or not
- What I want to know at the end of today: disregarding the learning curve, would a tool such as Pivotal Tracker help your group's productivity?
- Your task:
  - Turn of Facebook, Twitter, and other social media
  - Split into your project groups, as you will be collaborating on this
  - Create an account on [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com); it's free
  - Create a sample project (*not* a blank project!)
  - Fool around with the interface to get an idea of what it can do
    - Add stories, modify stuff, understand the UI features, display options, etc.
    - Talk with each other about how this would be used
    - Understand how this integrates with github (just google for "pivotal tracker github integration")
    - You should be spending ~30-40 minutes on all of this -- the idea is for you to really understand how it works!
    - You should be experts at this tool by the end of today's lecture!
  - Fill out the survey at https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/ptsurvey (it's all of 4 questions)
    - This is where you tell me how useful it would be
    - This is also today's attendance, so be sure to fill it out!

  - You can submit regrades (through the end of this week) via the course management system
when they were returned (Sep 29)
- If you are fine with your git hw grade, ***PLEASE DELETE YOUR GIT HW REPOS***

## Iteration 2 Goals
- You should pick 24 or 28 story points worth of "stuff" to do; pick the highest priority stuff!
- Your regular iteration meeting with the customer and Jamie should happen
- Specific goals:
  - Generate wireframes (see the [wireframing lecture](../../slides/fall/09-wireframing.html) and consider using [jetstrap](http://jetstrap.com))
  - Set up everybody's development environment (see the [development environment setup](../../docs/dev-env-setup.html) ([md](../../docs/dev-env-setup.md)) page)
    - Enable easy deployment via automatic logins or ssh keys
    - Enable easy downloading of the database
    - Ensure that *everybody* in the development group can develop on his/her own machine
- Requirements document
  - Your requrements document will be iterated on throughout the year
  - What format you keep it in is up to you, but I need to be able to view it
  - Having the original source (in the [uva-slp/projects repo](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects) repo) in a `docs` directory in your repo is quite reasonable
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="endofphase"><script type="text/template">
## Phase Change
- All groups will have a *phase change* at the end of iteration 2
  - This means a new lead and new secretary take over
  - The new lead should indicate that they are such to the customer (either by email or at your next meeting)
  - I'll be sending the new leads info on their lead-ness
- And there is an "end-of-phase" survey to complete
  - Completing this survey is a course requirement
  - All info that you put down is confidential -- no other students in this class will see your results
  - I may release *averages* and such, as long as it preserves anonyminity
  - I will not be basing your grades on your responses, so please be honest and frank!  And verbose.

## Upcoming Iteration Goals
- Future iterations this semester will have fewer explicit goals
- For all iterations, you should pick 24 or 28 story points worth of "stuff" to do; pick the highest priority stuff!
- Some specific iteration goals follow:
- Iteration 3: show the wireframe to the customer, get their feedback, iterate on the design
- Iteration 4: implement continuous integration testing (more on this in a future lecture)
- Iteration 5: get a preliminary system that implements the minimum requirements working
- Iteration 6: get a final system that implements the minimum requirements working
  - Keep in mind that *this* is the goal you are working toward this entire semester!

  - Everybody got them in, albeit some were late
  - Everybody can view the submitted reports through the [reporting system](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/slp/)
  - Details can be found in the [course introduction slide set](../../slides/fall/01-intro.html), specifically [here](../../slides/fall/01-intro.html#weeklyreport)
- Don't forget to report your hours!!!
  - This is a course requirement -- not completing them will result in a failure for the course
- Grades for the first three homeworks have been returned
  - You can submit regrades (through the end of this week) via the course management system
when they were returned (Sep 29)
- If you are fine with your git hw grade, ***PLEASE DELETE YOUR GIT HW REPOS***
  - They are all showing up in my listings...
  - Or you can remove myself and Jamie as collaborators
  - One of these two options will be needed to get credit!
- As there was no group meeting day on Monday, we'll have one today
- ACM game night this Thursday at 8 p.m. in Rice 436!

## Iteration 2
- You should pick 24 or 28 story points worth of "stuff" to do; pick the highest priority stuff!
- Your regular iteration meeting with the customer and Jamie should happen
- Specific goals:
  - Generate wireframes (see the [wireframing lecture](../../slides/fall/09-wireframing.html) and consider using [jetstrap](http://jetstrap.com))
  - Set up everybody's development environment (see the [development environment setup](../../docs/dev-env-setup.html) ([md](../../docs/dev-env-setup.md)) page)
    - Enable easy deployment via automatic logins or ssh keys
    - Enable easy downloading of the database
    - Ensure that *everybody* in the development group can develop on his/her own machine
- Requirements document
  - Your requrements document will be iterated on throughout the year
  - What format you keep it in is up to you, but I need to be able to view it
  - Having the original source (in the [uva-slp/projects repo](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects) repo) in a `docs` directory in your repo is quite reasonable

## A few clarifications
- Issues in github should be development-related, not meeting-related
- Your landing page on your project's URL should point to the various CRUD pages (and put in a reasonable title, etc.)
  - Remember that this is what you are going to demo to the customer!
- Your database schema should be called schema.sql (or schema.py, or schema.rb, etc.), and should be in the root directory of your repo, so that we can find it

## Reporting System
- Two ways to access it
  - Via the "Reporting" tool in Collab
  - Through netbadge via https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/slp/ (netbadge *should* work, but only on https, not http)
    - (please use that URL -- even though it's a redirect, the final URL will be changing soon, but that redirect will still point to the right one)
- This is how you submit your reports for this course
- Features
  - Submit, view, and edit reports
  - Submit, view, and edit hours worked
  - View attendance, evaluations, grades, leadership iterations, and project members
- We'll see a tour of it today

- How to initalize the repo with git...
  - You *should* add a readme.md file (and fill it in appropriately)
- I need to know, soonish, the platform choice of that one last group...
- Properly configured URLs (here 'project' is your project tag):
  - CakePHP: put the files in project@server:~/html; the URL will be http://server/~project/ (no configuration from me needed); in all cases, http://server/project redirects to http://server/~project
  - Ruby: the files will go in ~/project (aka ~project/project), and the URL will be http://server/project; this is alrady configured on the web server
  - Django: it's all working!  Directions on the next slide; the URL will be http://server/project

## Django instructions
- Create the django project:
```
django-admin startproject project
```
  - And set up the DB, etc.
- Create the Django app:
```
django manage.py startapp app
```
  - This implies that the static directory is: app/static/app/
- Set the Django app's URLs, as described in the "Setting the static directory" section of the [Django getting started](../../docs/django-getting-started.html) ([md](../../docs/django-getting-started.md)) page
- Change the location of the static directory in settings.py, as described on that same page in the "Setting the static directory" section
  - This may require different settings.py on the local machine and on the server
- Upload those files to the project accout, and then (as the project user), run:
```
wsgi-admin -register <wsgi.py> -app app -root
```
- At this point, your project should be available at http://server/project

  - The [CakePHP: getting started](../../docs/cakephp-getting-started.html) ([md](../../docs/cakephp-getting-started.md)) page lists three more commands you need to run to get your VirtualBox image ready
- All parts are ready!
- You can veiw your page at http://server/~mst3k
  - Your login credentials are in the PostEm tool in Collab
  - ssh RSA key fingerprint is 51:c6:7e:a6:44:b3:8e:f9:85:57:e0:7f:fb:c7:20:d3
  - ssh ECDSA key fingerprint is ed:1c:0e:61:94:2c:3f:53:d1:f1:dd:90:9b:f7:cb:a7

## Project Descriptions

See the https://github.com/uva-slp/projects repository (you all have access).

Specifically, see the [2014/readme.md](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects/blob/master/2014/readme.md) file.  Let's chat about the projects...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## The survey
- You will shortly receive an email to participate
- You really do have to read through *each* of the requirements documents
  - You don't have to memorize every detail; you can skim some of the finer details here
  - But for your top choice projects, you really do need to read through the entire thing
- A listing of the survey questions is in the [uva-slp/projects](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects) repository
  - In [2014/survey](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects/tree/master/2014/survey)
  - There are four parts, which we'll go over today

- Basically, a developer wrote 23k lines of GPL'ed code which allows Minecraft plug-ins...
  - And this code is not allowed to be used in commercial applications unless they release the code...
  - And since they are not releasing the code, this has to be resolved before development continues...
  - And it may shut down Minecraft plugins until the framework can be re-written

  - The image is on Collab ([direct link](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/54bcbf62-81cb-45bc-bf8c-c7d46467bba5/kubuntu-14.04.1.vdi.zip)); installation instructions can be found [here](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/tutorials/01-intro-unix/virtual-box.html); details about the image can be found [here](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/tutorials/01-intro-unix/vb-image-details.html)
  - Be aware that VirtualBox 4.3.14 (the current version) does not work well if you have anti-virus software installed; consider installing 4.3.12 instead
- Unlike CS 2150, I don't care what system you develop on
  - But most (if not all) of the software will be on a LAMP system, so you'll have to use something similar to LAMP.  I've seen people set up Mac OS X to run MAMP, and Window to run WAMP...
- Please fill out the [github userid survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ker2iMrVsEqfE_lmsb850Sq2vyLZ0NNWlFjmf5LXRHw/viewform) by early next week!  Say, by the end of Tuesday.
  - I will need that information to get your assignments graded, and to release the proejct information to you
