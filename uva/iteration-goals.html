## Iteration Goals

## Purpose

- This slide set is the collection of iteration goals, which are gone over in the [daily announcements](daily-announcements.html#/) slide set
- It's meant to have all the iteration goals in one place; all this information is presented elsewhere to the class
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it6goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 6
- Complete 24 / 28 / 32 story points worth of stuff
- Get customer feedback on the preliminary system (from the last iteration), and iterate on that design
- Complete the final system that implements the minimum requirements, and have it working on the course server
- Complete a preliminary *deployment plan*, which details the eventual final deployment: where, when, how, cost, etc.
- Everybody should complete 5 more unit tests
  - This means you should have about 20 unit tests per team member: about 120, 140, or 160 (depending on group size)
- Individual tasks
  - Complete the individual project that is in lieu of the final exam
  - Upload your STS prospectus (if you are using this class for STS 4500)
 - At the very end, complete the end-of-phase survey
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it5goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 5
- Complete 24 / 28 / 32 story points worth of stuff
- In the first week, complete the end-of-phase survey
- Have a preliminary system that implements the minimum requirements working on the course server
  - Recall that the final system to implement the minimum requirements is due by the end of iteration 6
- Ask the customer about where the system will be deployed
- Everybody should complete 5 more unit tests
  - This means you should have about 15 unit tests per team member
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it4goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 4
- Complete 24 / 28 / 32 story points worth of stuff
- Everybody should complete 5 more unit tests
  - You don't need to also do a fixture, as long as you did one in the last iteration
  - This means you should have about 10 unit tests per team member
- The wireframes should be (presumably) finalized, and likely implemented, by the end of this iteration
  - Please still keep copies in the docs/wireframes directory in your repo!
- As the iterations continue, there will be fewer specific requirements (other than "do work" and "write tests")
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it3goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 3
- Complete 24 / 28 / 32 story points worth of stuff
  - Some of this will be the work done on the wireframing, some will be the work done on the CI testing
  - Your site should have significnantly more functionality than last time
- In the first week, complete the end-of-phase survey
- Show the wireframe to the customer, get their feedback, iterate on the design
- You will have to configure your site with one of two CI servers: [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/) or [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
  - The [last two slides](../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/howtobegin) of the [Continuous Integration Testing](../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/) slide set discuss how to begin
  - Each group was assigned to one or the other; assignments are [here](../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/assignments)
  - The respective CI server is already set up to run tests on your repo on every push
  - Yout have to write the configuration file to get it to work properly
  - Extensive instructions for how to configure it (as well as sample configured projects) are available: the [CI testing slide set](../slides/09-ci-testing.html), the [CI setup](../docs/ci-setup.html) page, and two sample configured repos ([cake3-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/cake3-test) and [django-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/django-test))
    - Because nobody is using Rails, the rails-test repo was not updated this year, and is not being made available
- You will have to write a number of unit tests (at least 5 per person)
  - And one fixture each!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it2goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 2
- Have a site that should start to look like a workable site for the requirements
  - Some just had one or two MVC components for the first iteration (which was fine, as that is what was required for then)
- Complete 24 / 28 / 32 story points worth of "stuff" (depending on group size)
- Your regular iteration meeting with the customer and the grad TA should happen
- Specific goals:
  - Generate wireframes: that's [today's lecture](../slides/08-wireframing.html#/); this will likely take 3 or 5 story points of work.  The intent is to show them to the customer in iteration 3
  - Enable easy deployment via automatic logins or ssh keys: see the [Development Environment Setup page](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/docs/dev-env-setup.html) for details.  This also includes enabling easy downloading of the database
  - Publishing to the course server is best done via a github web hook and deploy key; see [that same page](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/docs/dev-env-setup.html) for details, but only I can set up both of those due to the github security setup
  - Ensure that *everybody* in the development group can develop on his/her own machine
- Some things to keep in mind:
  - Your requrements document will be iterated on throughout the year
  - What format you keep it in is up to you (although we recommend markdown), but we need to be able to view it
  - Having the source (from the [uva-slp/projects repo](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects) repo) copied into a `docs/` directory in your repo is quite reasonable
	  </script></section>

## Goals for iteration 1
See [here](../slides/05-project-start.html#/it1goals) for full details, but briefly:

- Fully understand the requirements
- Meet with the customer
- Design (and implement) a basic DB schema
- Get your dev environment set up (see [uva-slp/tutorails](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) for guidance)
- Get a basic MVC site working on the course server
  - Once done, this will require you emailing me so that I can complete the apache2 configuration
- Have the system stored properly in the github repo (no passwords!!!)
- Enter all the requirements as tasks as Github issues (this is next Wednesday)
- Everybody MUST have a github commit this iteration (and, in general, every iteration)
