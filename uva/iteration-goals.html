	  <section data-markdown id="it11goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 11
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Complete the full transition plan
  - Really this means make any edits or updates to the [master test plan](../slides/12-testing.html#/mastertestplan), [deployment plan](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/deployment-plan), and [installation instructions](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/installation)
  - This is the document deliverable for this iteration; but if those are fully up to date, then there will not be much work to do on this part
- Ensure the system is at 80% code coverage
  - And update the [code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage) report in the docs/coverage/ directory
- Note that the system was *fully deployed* on the destination server last iteration
- The system must be *feature complete* (meaning all the minimum and desired requirements) by the end of this iteration
  - It must be running on both the course server as well as the deployment host
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it10goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 10
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Complete the [master test plan](../slides/12-testing.html#/mastertestplan)
  - This is the document deliverable for this iteration
- Ensure the system is at 70% code coverage
  - And update the [code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage) report in the docs/coverage/ directory
- Ensure that your other deliverables are up to date, along with your requirements document
  - That's the [deployment plan](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/deployment-plan) and
[installation instructions](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/installation)
- The system must be *fully deployed* on the destination server
  - It's expected that the system will likely not be feature complete at this point
  - Submit an 'other' report that contains the URL of the deployed system, as well as credentials that myself and the grad TA can use to log in and see how well it works
    - We won't mess anything up on the deployed system; we'll use the course server to do that...
- Keep in mind that the system must be feature complete by the end of iteration 11, so plan your work accordingly
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it9goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 9
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Complete the [code coverage report](../slides/12-testing.html#/codecoverage)
  - The system must be at 60% code coverage!
  - That report should be in a docs/coverage/ directory; the output of your code coverage command is the format we are looking for
  - This is the document deliverable for this iteration
- Ensure that your other deliverables are up to date, along with your requirements document
  - That's the [deployment plan](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/deployment-plan) and
[installation instructions](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/installation)
- Keep in mind that the system must be fully deployed (if not yet fully complete) by the end of iteration 10
- Keep in mind that the system must be feature complete by the end of iteration 11, so plan your work accordingly
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it8goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 8
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- This iteration starts the regular meetings with the customer and also the graduate TA
- Write the [installation instructions](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/installation)
  - Enter that as a docs/installation-instructions.md file in the repo
  - This is the document deliverable for this iteration
- Keep in mind that the system must be feature complete by the end of iteration 11, so plan your work accordingly
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it7goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 7
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Update the requirements document with the work to be done for this semester
  - Since the minimum requirements were done last semester, this should all be under desired requirements
  - But this may need to be adjusted depending on last semester's progress, customer feedback, etc.
- Write the [deployment plan](../slides/11-deliverables.html#/deployment-plan)
  - Enter that as a docs/deployment-plan.md file in the repo
  - This is the document deliverable for this iteration
- Get feedback from the customer about the system, either in person or by email
  - This will be used to edit the requirements document and the github issues
- Edit the github issues to make them as reasonably accurate as you can at this point
- Plan out what to do in the next iteration (include that in the TPS report)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it6goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 6
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Get customer feedback on the preliminary system (from the last iteration), and iterate on that design
- Complete the final system that implements the minimum requirements, and have it working on the course server
- Have the customer start using and testing the system via an email, CC'ed to me, that requests that they start testing the sytsem over break
  - Also mention that you'll likely be out of contact until mid-January
- Complete a preliminary *deployment plan*: a Markdown document in your repo as docs/deployment-plan.md that has all the known deployment info
- Everybody should complete 5 more unit tests
  - This means you should have at least 15 unit tests per team member
- Meet with the grad TA and demo your final system
  - If the meeting time is doing to cause scheduling issues (during a final, after you've left grounds, etc.), you can request a different time to meet
  - If you meeting is early in the iteration, it's fine if some functionality is not yet finished; we can check that when it's all done
- Individual tasks
  - Complete the individual project that is in lieu of the final exam
  - Upload your STS prospectus (if you are using this class for STS 4500)
  - At the very end, complete the end-of-phase survey
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it5goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 5
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- In the first week, complete the end-of-phase survey
- Have a preliminary system that implements the minimum requirements working on the course server
  - Recall that the final system to implement the minimum requirements is due by the end of iteration 6
- Ask the customer about where the system will be deployed
  - When you get a response (even if that response is "I don't know yet"), please fill out an 'other' report
  - The intent here is to get the customer to start thinking about it; you don't need them to have any or all of the details at this point
- No more unit tests this iteration (but there will be more required next iteration)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it4goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 4
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Everybody should complete 5 more unit tests
  - You don't need to also do a fixture, as long as you did one in the last iteration
  - This means you should have about 10 unit tests per team member
- The wireframes should be (presumably) finalized, and likely implemented, by the end of this iteration
  - Please still keep copies in the docs/wireframes directory in your repo!
- As the iterations continue, there will be fewer specific requirements (other than "do work" and "write tests")
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it3goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 3
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
  - Some of this will be the work done on the wireframing, some will be the work done on the CI testing
  - Your site should have significnantly more functionality than last time
- In the first week, complete the end-of-phase survey
- Show the wireframe to the customer, get their feedback, iterate on the design
- You will have to configure your site with one of two CI servers: [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/) or [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
  - The [last two slides](../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/howtobegin) of the [Continuous Integration Testing](../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/) slide set discuss how to begin
  - Each group was assigned to one or the other; assignments are [here](../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/assignments)
  - The respective CI server is already set up to run tests on your repo on every push
  - Yout have to write the configuration file to get it to work properly
  - Extensive instructions for how to configure it (as well as sample configured projects) are available: the [CI testing slide set](../slides/09-ci-testing.html), the [CI setup](../docs/ci-setup.html) page, and two sample configured repos ([cake3-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/cake3-test) and [django-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/django-test))
    - Because nobody is using Rails, the rails-test repo was not updated this year, and is not being made available
- You will have to write a number of unit tests (at least 5 per person)
  - And one fixture each!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it2goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 2
- Have a site that should start to look like a workable site for the requirements
  - Some just had one or two MVC components for the first iteration (which was fine, as that is what was required for then)
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Your regular iteration meeting with the customer and the grad TA should happen
- Specific goals:
  - Generate wireframes: that's [today's lecture](../slides/08-wireframing.html#/); this will likely take 3 or 5 story points of work.  The intent is to show them to the customer in iteration 3
  - Enable easy deployment via automatic logins or ssh keys: see the [Development Environment Setup page](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/docs/dev-env-setup.html) for details.  This also includes enabling easy downloading of the database
  - Publishing to the course server is best done via a github web hook and deploy key; see [that same page](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/docs/dev-env-setup.html) for details, but only I can set up both of those due to the github security setup
  - Ensure that *everybody* in the development group can develop on his/her own machine
- Some things to keep in mind:
  - Your requrements document will be iterated on throughout the year
  - What format you keep it in is up to you (although we recommend markdown), but we need to be able to view it
  - Having the source (from the [uva-slp/projects repo](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects) repo) copied into a `docs/` directory in your repo is quite reasonable
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it1goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for iteration 1
See [here](../slides/05-project-start.html#/it1goals) for full details, but briefly:

- Fully understand the requirements
- Meet with the customer
- Design (and implement) a basic DB schema
- Get your dev environment set up (see [uva-slp/tutorails](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) for guidance)
- Get a basic MVC site working on the course server
  - Once done, this will require you emailing me so that I can complete the apache2 configuration
- Have the system stored properly in the github repo (no passwords!!!)
- Enter all the requirements as tasks as Github issues (this is next Wednesday)
- Everybody MUST have a github commit this iteration (and, in general, every iteration)
