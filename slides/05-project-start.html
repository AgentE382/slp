# Survey Statistics
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Introduction
- There are 98 people in the course
  - Although only 97 filled out the survey
- I spent over 8 hours working on the project assignments...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Stats
- Most popular projects:
  - Highest project had 28 people select it as their first choice
  - Next highest project had 14
  - Third highest project had 11
- As there were 42 (of 97: 43%) requesting two projects, obviously not all first choice requests could be honored...
- Seven projects have 7 people, and eight projects have 6 people
  - Which ones was due to balancing the preferences
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Choices
- It turned out that sorting by 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th choice projects didn't work well
- Instead, the primary metric was the individual project ratings
- With two exceptions, *everybody* got a project they rated a 4 or a 5
  - One exception was a person who rated everything a 3
  - The other was a person who wanted a particular group of students, and not a particular project
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Choices
- 49 students (51%) got a project they rated as a 5
- 46 students (47%) got a project they rated as a 4
- 2 students (2%) got a project they rated as a 3
- Only 20 students (21%) got a project rated *lower* than their top choice
- Average assigned project rating: 4.48
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Platform Preferences
- Average overall platform preference: 3.21
  - Preferences: cake: 2.51; rails: 3.59; django: 3.54
- If the expected platforms are chosen, then only 4 people got a platform they rated as a 2
  - But in all those cases, they listed a preference for the projects over the platforms
- Although somebody selected a Django-required proejct as their first choice (and got it), but rated Django a 1...
  - So I don't know what to make of that case, and am ignoring it...
- Expected platform count: django: 9, cake: 1, ruby: 5
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Friends and Enemies
- Nobody got his/her mortal enemies
  - I had to do a *lot* of re-arranging for all of this
- I tried to preserve BFFs
  - This worked best when the BFFs all seleted each other, and had the same project/platform choices, and the listing of BFFs were *large* (i.e., 6-7 people)
  - In many cases, because the project/platform choices were dissimilar, the BFF choices could not be followed
- I did try to pay attention to this, but the problem is rather over-constrained...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## MySQL knowledge
- Most teams have at least one person with MySQL knowledge of 4 or higher
  - Two don't, but they have multiple people at a 3
- Average MySQL knowledge overall was 3.09
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Changes for next year
- Individual project rankings, but not 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th choices
- No more BFFs
  - It takes up way too much of my time, and then people just get mad at me because somebody else got their BFFs but they didn't
  - But I'll still ask for mortal enemies
	  </script></section>

# Project assignments
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Assignments
- It's a [local file](../../../work/slp/groups/groups.html)
- The other members in your group, as well as their UVa userids, can be found in the PostEm tool
  - You'll meet them shortly
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project tag
- Each project has a *tag* -- a short, single word -- which is the name for the project
  - This was shown after your name in the listing just shown
- This tag can be found in the Collab PostEm tool
- This tag is used for:
  - The name of your github repo (http://github/uva-slp/tag)
  - Your team login on the course server
  - The URL; see next slide
  - The basis for the DB name on the server (it's `slp_tag`)
  - Generally how your project will be referred to
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project tags and URLs
- The server name is the same as for the homeworks
- Rails and Djano projects will be at http://server/tag
- CakePHP projects will be at http://server/~tag
  - Note the tilde ('~') in there
  - But http://server/tag will *redirect* to http://server/~tag

# Next Steps
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## 2016-2017 Iteration schedule
- All iterations start on a Tuesday and end on a Monday two weeks later
- Iterations start on Tuesday, September 20th
- There are 6 iterations in the fall
  - Sep 20 -> Oct 3, Oct 4 -> 17, Oct 18 -> Oct 31, Nov 1 -> 14, Nov 15 -> 28, Nov 29 -> 12
  - The last half of iteration 6 is during finals week
- There are 8 iterations in the spring
  - Jan 17 -> Jan 30, Jan 31 -> 13, Feb 14 -> 27, Feb 28 -> 13, Mar 14 -> 27, Mar 28 -> Apr 10, Apr 11 -> 24, Apr 25 -> May 8
  - Iteration 10 contains spring break
  - The last half of iteration 14 is during finals week
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Phases
- There are 14 iterations this year
- Fall semester: all groups will have three phases in the fall semester: iterations 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6
- Spring semester
  - 6 person groups will have 3 phases in the spring: 7-9, 10-11, 12-14
  - 7 person groups will have 4 phases in the spring: 7-8, 9-10, 11-12, 13-14
- I will remind you of all of this when the time comes
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project leadership roles
- Everybody will be lead for one phase and secretary for another
- Restrictions
  - Nobody can have two leadership roles in the fall
    - Thus, 7 person groups will have one person that has both roles in the spring
  - You can not be the lead and secretary for the same iteration
- You must decide today who is the lead and secretary for the *entire* year
  - You can change this later, subject to the restrictions above, by emailing me
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Pick leadership roles
- How you pick is completely up to you
- If you can't decide, then I propose the following:
  - Sort everybody by (formal) first names in *reverse* order, and that is the order of the leads
  - The 4th person in that list is the first secretary, and it cycles through
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Leads
- Person responsible for submitting reports
  - We will see the custom course management system for submitting them on Wednesday; first report is not due until next week
- Responsible for reserving the rooms, creating the agenda for the meeting, and keeping the meeting on track
- This is an *administrative* role, not an *authoritative* one
- At the start of one's time as project lead, I send them an email summarizing their duties
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Reserving rooms
- You can reserve a Rice Hall conference room in one of three ways:
  - By swinging by Rice 527 (the main CS office)
    - Ask nicely, and tell them you are in CS 4970
  - By emailing office@cs.virginia.edu
    - Ask nicely, and tell them you are in CS 4970
  - By asking me during my office hours
    - Ask nicely, and tell them you are in CS 4970
      - Wait, what?
    - I'm too slow at responding to e-mails to have reservations that way...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Secretary
- This is the person who will take notes at each meeting
- Each meeting (of all types) MUST have notes!
  - This is how I am going to be able to keep up with all the projects
  - Notes must include who was present
- They will need to be entered into the custom course management system that I will show you on Wednesday
- The secretary will rotate through everybody, just like the project lead
  - And the secretary can not be the project lead in the same iteration
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Remember to report time
- Keep track of ALL time you expend for this course
  - Meetings (customer and not), learning CakePHP, etc.
- The only things you should NOT include are Monday's group meetings and Wednesday's lecture
- This is to be reported via the custom course management that I will show you on Wednesday
  - Recall that you grade will NEVER depend (one way or the other) on how much time you report
  - But there WILL be a grade penalty if you do *not* enter any time
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Scheduling the first meeting
- The project lead should contact the customer listed in the requirements document
  - <font color="red">But not before I give the go-ahead, as I want to talk to them first!</font>
  - I expect that to be later today or early tomorrow.
- But you should really wait until after Wednesday's lecture to *have* the meeting
- Then arrange an initial meeting
  - A note about travel...
  - You may not be able to meet this week, due to scheduling issues
- Secretary: remember to take notes!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Emaling the customer
- Wait until I give the go ahead!
- Introduce yourself, and tell them that you are on the project team that will be working on their SLP project
  - Their emails are in the requirements document
- Be polite and professional!
- Propose some times to meet, based on the team's schedule
  - But be open to other meeting times
  - And mention any travel restrictions
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Stuff on my todo list...
- At some point today or tomorrow you will receive from me:
  - A e-mail from me that is the go-ahead to contact the customer
  - Updated course server account information (in particular, the group account information)
  - Another email from me indicating that the github repos are all ready
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it1goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for iteration 1, part 1
- Fully understand the requirements
  - Generate questions to ask the customer!
  - This may mean that the requirements document is updated or changed; the original source version is in the [uva-slp/projects repo](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects) in three formats: HTML, PDF, and Markdown
- Meet with the customer
  - As the questions that you generated!
- Design (and implement) a basic DB schema
  - And enter it into your course server group DB, or generate the DB tables (into that DB) via Rails or Django
- Get your dev environment set up
  - See the [uva-slp/tutorails](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) repo for guidance
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Goals for iteration 1, part 2
- Get a basic MVC website working on the course server (CRUD operations for the schema tables)
  - This should all be working on the course server by the end of the iteration
- Have the system stored properly in the github repo
  - You are all members of your respective repos
  - I will give directions for initalizing the repo later this week
  - ***PASSWORDS ARE NOT TO BE STORED IN THE REPO***
  - Your system should be in an app/ directory, or similar
    - Don't have all the various files for the Django/Rails/CakePHP in the root directory....
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Goals for iteration 1, part 3
- Enter all the requirements as tasks as Github issues
  - We'll talk about this in an upcoming class
- Everybody MUST have a github commit this iteration!
  - Even if your work is not code based, commit something
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Nametags
- I am going to give each group a set of "Hello, my name is..." nametags on Wednesday
  - Do *not* fill in "Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
- And a Sharpie marker for each group
  - They are too hard to read when written in pen or pencil
- You are to use these in each of the *customer* meetings until you run out
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## For the rest of today's lecture
- Split off into groups
  - Select leads and a secretaries for the year
  - Select a platform, if you can decide on one today
  - Fill out that information on the [SLP Project Start Information Sheet](../uva/project-start-info-sheet-2016.pdf), and turn that in before you leave
- Look over the requirements document
- Generate a list of questions and clarifications that you want to get from the customer
  - The secretary should take notes!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Meeting your groups
- I selected meeting locations for each group
  - It's a [local file](../../../work/slp/groups/meeting-locations.png)
- And if you forgot your project assignment already, that's in this [local file](../../../work/slp/groups/groups.html)
