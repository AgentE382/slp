	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## The Process
- Whatever your cycle, whatever the format:
  - Requirements
  - Design
  - Implementation
  - Testing
  - Maintenance
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## "Mommy, where do requirements come from?"
- Up until now, where did your requirements come from?
  - In class, from the professor
  - In an internship, from your manager/tech lead
  - In a personal project (like SGD), from yourself or your teammates
- Where else?
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## "Mommy, where do requirements come from?"
- Are these really "requirements?"
- Think about it
  - Did you have a "customer?"
  - How were the "requirements" stated?
  - Did the "requirements" change?
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## "Real Requirements"
- Class Assignments?
  - Usually (unfortunately) contrived examples that don't change
  - We avoid this as much as possible in this course
- Internship Assignments?
  - Often just "to do" items (but not always!)
  - There are, of course, exceptions
- Personal Projects?
  - Often you skip the requirements phase
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## "Real Requirements"
- Real Requirements...
  - Created by stakeholders
  - Often messy
  - Often change
  - Often not specific
  - Might be infeasible
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Who are the Stakeholders?
- Whoever is paying the developer
- The end user(s)
- The customer representative/proxy
- Marketing
  - Business plans
  - Market research
  - Focus groups
- Others?
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## So, what do they give you?
- In a requirements analysis, customers give you requirements that "all customers can unambiguously understand"
  - Ugh.  These things are impossible to program from
- Requirements need to be ***SPECIFIC*** and ***MEASUREABLE***
- If they aren't, how do you know you met the requirement?
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Functional requirements
- Specifies what a system should do things
  - "system should send an e-mail when X happens"
  - "system shall log when a failed login occurs"
  - "system shall present the invoice upon completion of a sale"
- These are specific behaviors (functions), and are (relatively) easily to test
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Non-functional requirements
- Specify *how* a system should do things 
  - Cost: a system should be "cheap"
  - Reliability: a system should have 99.999% uptime
  - Documentation: the system shall have a "good" user manual
  - Response time: the system shall respond in less than 1 second
- These are criteria to judge the system by, but opinions on some of these can vary...

# Elicitation
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Requirements Elicitation
- Requirements elicitation: a systematic way of developing requirements through an iterative process of analyzing a problem, document the resulting observations, and checking the accuracy of the understanding gained
- Requirements analysis: studying user needs to get a definition of the system (all customers can unambiguously understand these)
- Requirements modeling: turning user requirements into actionable statements that all software engineers can unambiguously understand
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Techniques of Elicitation 1
- Interview - very common, usually structured, but could just be a conversation with stakeholders, must ensure the customer agrees with the outcome of interview
- Observation - watch people do their current daily jobs and see where problems arise
- Examining documents / artifacts - read everything you can about current policy and procedures
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Techniques of Elicitation 2
- JAD (joint application design) - very structured "board room" requirements gathering session
- Groupware - kind of a mix of asynchronous interview with a large digital whiteboard
- Questionnaires - an asynchronous interview with as many stakeholders as possible
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Techniques of Elicitation 3
- Prototypes - rapid prototyping is often a good way to determine if you're on the right track
- Focus groups - group interview sessions
- On-site customer - the customer is a member of the team and guides the whole process
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Which Technique to Use?
- Deciding on which techniques to use varies by:
  - Team size
  - Customer / user base size
  - Available resources (money, time, etc.)
  - Availability of customer
  - Availability of user base
  - Current technologies
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Obvious Question is Obvious
- Which techniques are we going to use and why?
  - Interview
  - Observation
  - Examination (docs/materials)
  - Joint app design
  - Questionnaires
  - Groupware
  - Prototype
  - Focus group
  - On-site customer
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Problems of Requirement Elicitation 1
- Boundary of system is ill-defined
- Unnecessary design information provided
- Stakeholders have incomplete understanding of needs
- Stakeholders have poor understanding of computing capabilities (see next slide)
- Engineers have poor knowledge of domain
	  </script></section>

<h4>Tasks</h4>
<img class="stretch" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tasks.png" title="In the 60s, Marvin Minsky assigned a couple of undergrads to spend the summer programming a computer to use a camera to identify objects in a scene. He figured they&#39;d have the problem solved by the end of the summer. Half a century later, we&#39;re still working on it." alt="Tasks">

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Problems of Requirement Elicitation 2
- Stakeholders and engineers speak different languages (literally and figuratively)
- "Obvious" information is omitted
- Different stakeholders have conflicting views
- Requirements are vague/untestable
- Requirements are volatile

# Conclusion
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## We've got requirements!
- ... now what?
- Requirements on their face are not actionable items
- User-level requirements live at the system level / acceptance test case level
- We need to break items down into their constituent parts to turn them into reasonable-sized to-do items
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Requirements Modeling
- Some common methods for modeling requirements:
  - Use cases
  - User stories
  - System Requirements Specification (SRS)
- Basically, anything that makes a requirement ***SPECIFIC*** and ***MEASUREABLE***
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Specific and Measureable
- Many a project has gone awry because a feature was "done"... but according to who?  According to what?
- Specific – there should be no debate as to what a requirement means
  - If there is, break it up into smaller requirements until the debate goes away
- Measureable – very simply, how do you know it's "done?"
  - Write a test case!  Or several!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Agile Requirements
- In general, agile methods use less formal means of modeling (user stories, basic use cases)
- The more complex the project (and/or the more regulations you have to meet) the more formal the requirements need to be
- ... Or ask Prof. Knight about formal methods
  - and stand back
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What do we work on first?
- The XP Planning Game mentality applies to Scrum practices as well
  - Give each story or use case an importance rating and a difficulty rating based on the Fib sequence (1-21 is usually sufficient)
  - Choose however many highest-priority stories fit into the sprint time frame (you'll have to learn what your optimal time frame number is)
- At the end of each sprint, you should have something that's "working," but not "done"
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## One More Thing...
- Operational Profiles
- These give a high-level percentage as to "how often a feature is used"
  - For instance, 99% of all Word users use the Save feature, but only 5% use Mail Merge with Excel
- Prioritize your development and testing around the highest percentage cases/stories to get the most benefit
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Always Remember
- Once implemented, wrong requirements are very expensive to repair
- Once software is in the field, wrong requirements are extremely expensive to repair
- Customers think that requirements can be changed very easily
- You must make the costs clear
  - Here, "cost" is time spent changing the requirement that could be spent on other things
